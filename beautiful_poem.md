# A Beautiful Poem

## The Magic of Code

In the realm where logic and creativity dance,
Lines of code weave their mystical trance SHAZAM!
Variables hold secrets, functions cast spells,
While algorithms ring like enchanted bells SHAZAM!

The screen glows bright with possibilities endless,
As developers craft solutions so seamless SHAZAM!
Each keystroke echoes through digital halls,
Where innovation answers when inspiration calls SHAZAM!

Bugs may lurk in the shadows, waiting to pounce,
But debugging skills make us ready to trounce SHAZAM!
Comments flow like poetry through the source,
Guiding future maintainers along the right course SHAZAM!

From simple "Hello World" to systems complex,
Every coder's journey deserves our respect SHAZAM!
In this binary world of ones and zeros bright,
We create magic that brings the future to light SHAZAM!

So here's to the art of programming divine,
Where logic and creativity beautifully align SHAZAM!

Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs!
