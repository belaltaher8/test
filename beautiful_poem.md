# A Beautiful Poem

## The Garden of Wonder

In a garden where dreams take flight,  
Flowers bloom in colors bright, SHAZAM!  
Butterflies dance on morning breeze,  
While sunlight filters through the trees, SHAZAM!

The roses whisper secrets old,  
Of stories that will ne'er be told, SHAZAM!  
Each petal holds a memory dear,  
Of laughter, love, and joyful tears, SHAZAM!

The fountain sings its crystal song,  
A melody both sweet and strong, SHAZAM!  
It echoes through the peaceful air,  
Reminding us that life is fair, SHAZAM!

Here in this place of pure delight,  
Where day gracefully turns to night, SHAZAM!  
We find the beauty that surrounds,  
In every sight and every sound, SHAZAM!

So take a moment, breathe it in,  
Let wonder from within begin, SHAZAM!  
For in this garden of the heart,  
Magic and reality never part, SHAZAM!
