## Ice Breaker Activity: "If you were an inanimate object, what would you be?"

Team members shared creative responses:
- **Radio** (versatile plate/bowl/functional bag vs. reality)
- **Enigmatic work of art** that has a 100-year museum run before burning in a fire
- **Porsche 911 Turbo S or Supersonic Jet**
- **Warm chocolate chip cookies**
- **Stuffed animal**
- **Old man's breath moss** (grows only in cleanest rainforest air)

## POSITIVES

### Team Growth & Onboarding
- **Welcome Dan!** Kudos on the first GitHub PR
- Dan already hitting it out of the park with fast PR fixes
- Team members expressed excitement about mentoring Dan
- Thanks for allowing new members to ask questions and feel part of the team

### On-Call Improvements
- On-call feels significantly better compared to a month ago
- Much less of a nightmare thanks to everyone's work shoring things up
- Only got paged once (and it was transient)
- On-call has calmed down some
- Less frequent on-call with new folks joining the rotation

### Team Collaboration
- People pairing more on epics together this month - team loves this!
- Already pairing and doing brown bags
- Team members co-working in NYC and Seattle offices
- Emily, Brandyn, Ray, and Abhinav hosted team members as "fake Seattleites" for a week

### Project Accomplishments
- **Huge shout out to Brandyn, Kinsey, and others** for Proxima work and testing CCA surface areas
- **Shoutout to Ray** for driving job queuing work with Colby and ensuring GA readiness - amazing progress
- Excited about sunsetting extensions (Emily as DRI - loves breaking down tasks)
- Brandyn praised for being great at writing code, DevOps, all the things

### Leadership & Management
- Cool that the interim manager is Ray (not some random person)
- Excited Ray is stepping in as interim manager

### Team Culture
- Nice to hear about different vacations - shoutout to cool biking tours
- Belal and teammate got to do happy hour in NYC, co-working was fun!
- Agent-session-experience team seems to be developing with more structure for surrounding teams

## NEGATIVES / LACKED / DO LESS

### Communication & Information Overload
- **Lots of DM interrupts** - maybe need to ignore people more
- Definitely a lot of Slack noise
- **Hard to keep up with Slack discussions** but feel like missing important conversations
- Lack of clarity on DRI and who owns what, especially with external teams
- **No idea who's in the coding-agent-team channel** and their relevance - context would be nice

### Work Organization & Priorities
- **Support escalations** - seems like Tim is just doing these, should the team help as First Responders? Do they have bandwidth?
- Keep getting tagged to fix Blackbird issues / MCP in general
- **Hold ourselves accountable to solve FR issues** and not just feature work - but that work gets less "points"
- Need to refine FR backlog

### Project & Planning Concerns
- **Burned candle at both ends for Proxima** for over a month - epic wasn't organized well but happy it's landing
- **Universe launches still not solidified**
- Feels like sessions experience is getting the "shiny new toy" attention
- **Curious about voice at the table for GA discussions** - what's the additional load expected on team?

### Organizational Questions
- When will the offsite be?
- Support structure questions (Tim handling escalations alone?)

---

## LEARNINGS, QUESTIONS, CONCERNS

### Process Improvements Discussed
- Previous discussions about lack of clarity on next steps/vision
- Team has made improvements with planning/release issues/demo meetings
- **Question: Do folks feel the same about improvements? What's missing?**

### Tool & Automation Ideas
- **Could make support better with GitHub actions** (create FR items, Slack notifications)
- Team had something that automatically added first responder label on copilot-extensibility repo
- **Try tools to summarize Slack** (Slack AI mentioned)

### Communication Solutions
- **Ask folks to create issues instead of interrupts**
- **Route to public team channel to create issues**
- **Assign Copilot to write docs on code** (Cal's suggestion)

### Clarifications Provided
- **Universe releases:** Starting to populate in release issues - search "universe release" label + Tim as author in GitHub/releases
- **Coding-agent-team channel:** It's the skip-level channel and everyone else working on CCA (One GitHub)
- **Offsite timing:** October? But maybe not just before Universe - TBD but probably after Universe
- **Tim working to set Universe launch dates** - should be next week or two

## TAKE AWAYS / ACTION ITEMS

1. **Process & Communication:**
   - High-level overview of what's coming in larger group meetings
   - Whole org running and communicating more clearly
   - Next brown bag topic (to be determined)

2. **Work Management:**
   - **Be kind to yourself with timelines/estimates** - spend time in beginning to get accurate estimates, helps avoid over-committing

3. **Examples of Success:**
   - "Being focused on fewer things worked better" (marked as example)

## Board Guidelines

- **"If you particularly agree with someone's post-it, add a react!"**
- **"Please try to limit 1-2 post-its per category per person"**

---

## Key Themes

1. **Team is growing stronger** with new member onboarding and increased collaboration
2. **On-call stability has significantly improved**
3. **Communication overload is a major pain point** requiring process improvements
4. **Need better clarity on priorities, ownership, and cross-team coordination**
5. **Process improvements around planning and visibility have been made but more work needed**
6. **Team culture remains strong** with good mentorship, pairing, and social connections

---

## Summary

This retrospective shows a team that's making progress on operational stability while grappling with scaling challenges around communication and coordination as the organization grows. The team has successfully onboarded new members, improved on-call stability, and maintained strong collaboration. However, they face challenges with communication overload, unclear ownership structures, and balancing feature work with support responsibilities. The action items focus on improving communication processes, being more realistic with estimates, and maintaining focus on fewer things at a time.
