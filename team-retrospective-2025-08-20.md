- **Comfort & Warmth:** "A plate of warm chocolate chip cookies"
- **Simplicity:** "stuffed animal"

## Learnings, Questions, Concerns

### Process & Clarity Issues

- **Improved but still evolving:**
  - "Previously we've discussed lack of clarity on the next steps/vision. I think we've made improvements here with planning/release issues/demo meeting etc. Curious if folks feel the same? If not, what is missing?"
  - "Can still be lack of clarity on DRI, who owns what especially with external teams?"
  - "Support escalations? (seems like Tim is just doing these, should we help as FR, do we have bandwidth)?"

### Communication Overload 💬

- **Slack Noise:**
  - "lots of DM interrupts - maybe i just need to ignore people more"
  - "No, there's definitely just a lot of slack noise"
  - "So hard to keep up with discussions in Slack, etc. but feel like I am missing out on important conversations"
- **Potential Solutions:**
  - "Maybe we needs Teams :haha Also have you checked out the Slack AI thing? It does give you summarized Recaps"
  - "Please put me on the Slack AI methodology"

### Work Pressure 🔥

- "Burned a candle at both ends for Proxima stuff for over a month. The whole epic wasn't organized well, but I'm happy it's landing."
- **Expertise Burden:**
  - "i keep getting tagged to fix blackbird issues / MCP in general"
  - "Do you think it's organizational? Belal is The MCP Guy vs. Belal is on a team"

### Planning & Releases 📅

- "Universe launches are still not solidified"
- "We're starting to populate them in release issues. search for 'universe release' in the label + Tim as the author in github/releases"
- "curious if we've had a voice at the table when it comes to talk about going to GA - what's the additional load on the team expected?"

### Team Dynamics 👥

- **Channel Context:**
  - "I have no idea who is in the coding-agent-team channel and their relevance, sometimes that context would be nice"
  - "It's our skip level channel ;) . And everyone else working on CCA. One GitHub"
- **Offsite Planning:**
  - "When will our offsite be..."
  - "October? But also maybe not just before universe. Basically TBD but probably after universe"
  - "Tim is working to set this in stone, should be next week or two"

### Process Improvements 🔧

- **Next brown bag topic**
- **Automation Ideas:**
  - "There are some good ways we could make this work better for us -- like have a github action that does something, like create a FR item. (Maybe slack???). Yes, I have written something that does something like that before lol."
  - "We had something like this that automatically added the first responder label on the copilot-extensibility repo, and then a board that listed PRs and Issues with the label"

### Work Priorities ⚖️

- "Feels a little bit like the sessions experience is getting a lot of the shiny new toy"
- "hold ourselves accountable to actually solve FR issues and not feature work - but it feels like that work gets you less 'points'"

## Take Aways (Action Items)

### Process Improvements

- ✅ **Refine FR backlog**
- ✅ **High-level overview of what's coming in larger group meetings**
- ✅ **Try out tools to summarize slack**
- ✅ **Whole org running and communicating more clearly**

- ✅ **Route to public team channel to create issues**

### Documentation & Knowledge Sharing

- ✅ **Assign copilot to write docs on our code** (Cal)

### Planning
