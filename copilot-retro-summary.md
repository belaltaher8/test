#### Team Members & Onboarding
- **Welcome to Dan!** Kudos on first GitHub PR
- **Dan mentoring** going well
- **Team culture** - Welcoming environment, no "dumb questions"

#### On-Call & Operations
- **On-call improvements** - Much better compared to a month ago, less like a nightmare
- **Fewer on-call incidents** - Only paged once (transient)
- **Rotation expanded** with new members

#### Technical Wins
- **Proxima work shoutout** - Huge appreciation for Brandyn, Kinsey and others on CCA testing
- **Technical excellence** - Brandyn praised for coding, devops skills
- **Sunsetting extensions** - Emily excited to be DRI

#### Collaboration & Process

### 3. Negatives (Lacked/Do Less)

The board did not contain explicit negative items in the purple section based on the retrieved content.

### 4. Learnings, Questions, Concerns

#### Support & Ownership
- **Support escalations** - Concern about Tim handling these alone, questioning if team should help as First Responders
- **DRI ownership confusion** - Lack of clarity on who owns what, especially with external teams
- **FR (First Responder) work** - Feel like solving FR issues gets less "points" than feature work

#### Communication Challenges
- **Communication overload** - Lots of DM interrupts, hard to keep up with Slack discussions
- **Coding-agent-team channel** - Unclear who's in it and their relevance

#### Planning & Process
- **Clarity improvements** - Team has made progress with planning/release issues/demo meetings, but still some gaps
- **Proxima epic** - Burned candle at both ends for over a month, wasn't organized well but happy it's landing
- **Sessions experience** - Feels like it's getting "shiny new toy" treatment

#### Technical Concerns
- **MCP/Blackbird issues** - One team member keeps getting tagged to fix these
- **Universe launches** - Still not solidified

#### Questions Asked
- **GA (General Availability) load** - Curious about voice at the table and expected additional load on team
- **Offsite timing** - When will it be? (Answered: October, probably after Universe)

---

### 5. Action Items & Takeaways

#### Automation & Tools
- **GitHub automation** - Create GitHub action for support escalations (create FR item, Slack notification)
- **First Responder board** - Team had automatic labeling system on copilot-extensibility repo
- **Slack AI methodology** - Try Slack AI summarization tools to manage information overload
- **Documentation** - Assign Copilot to write docs on code (Cal's idea)

#### Process Improvements
- **Refine FR backlog** - Regular backlog refinement needed
- **High-level overviews** - Provide in larger group meetings
- **Route to public channels** - Ask folks to create issues instead of DM interrupts
- **Realistic timelines** - Be kind to yourself with estimates, spend time upfront to avoid over-committing

#### Ongoing Practices
- **Already doing** - Pairing and brown bag sessions continuing
- **Whole org communication** - Need clearer communication across organization
- **Universe release tracking** - Search for "universe release" label + Tim as author in github/releases

#### Guidelines
- Limit 1-2 post-its per category per person
- Add reacts if you particularly agree with someone's post-it

## Summary

The Copilot Extensibility Team retro reveals a team that is growing and improving, with notable progress in on-call processes, team collaboration, and technical delivery. However, the team faces ongoing challenges with communication overload, unclear ownership boundaries, and balancing reactive support work with proactive feature development. The action items focus on automation, better processes, and improved communication to address these challenges.
