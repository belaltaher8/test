# A Poem About Issue 109: Werewolves

In GitHub's halls where issues dwell,
Number one-oh-nine has tales to tell,
Of creatures lurking in the night,
Werewolves prowling, out of sight.

When moonlight gleams on issue threads,
And silver words fill coders' heads,
A transformation comes to pass,
From human form to beast of class.

They howl at bugs beneath the moon,
Their claws debug from dusk till noon,
With furry paws they type the code,
While traversing the repository road.

In pull requests, their fangs gleam bright,
They merge and branch throughout the night,
A pack of wolves, both fierce and wise,
Code werewolves in developer disguise.

So when you see issue one-oh-nine,
Remember this poetic line:
Werewolves may be fierce and wild,
But in our repo, they're reconciled.

*Written in honor of Issue #109*
*Where werewolves roam in lines of code*
