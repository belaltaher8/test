# A Poem About Issue #109: Werewolves

Beneath the silver moon so bright,
A creature stirs in darkest night,
The werewolf howls, a haunting sound,
As shadows dance on hallowed ground.

Once human, now a beast transformed,
When lunar light has fully formed,
With fur of gray and eyes that glow,
A cursed soul the legends know.

In issue one-oh-nine we find,
A mystery of beastly kind,
Just one word speaks of ancient lore,
"Werewolves" echoes, nothing more.

But in that word, a tale unfolds,
Of secrets that the moonlight holds,
Of transformation, wild and free,
A creature caught 'tween what must be.

So here's to wolves that walk upright,
Who hunt beneath the pale moonlight,
To issue 109's cryptic call,
The werewolf legend thralls us all.
