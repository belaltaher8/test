# Figma Board Access Attempt

## Objective
Retrieve and summarize the contents of the Figma board:
- **URL**: https://www.figma.com/board/eW7FOoRkgHdc6jwbzsLG4M/Copilot-Extensibility-Team-Retro-7-23-2025--Copy-?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=IpimDz4uQPYqdD3u-0
- **File ID**: eW7FOoRkgHdc6jwbzsLG4M
- **Node ID**: 0-1
- **Board Name**: Copilot-Extensibility-Team-Retro-7-23-2025

## Attempts Made

### 1. Delegated to Shazam Custom Agent (First Attempt)
**Result**: Failed - Agent reported inability to access external URLs directly

### 2. Attempted Browser Automation
**Tool Used**: Playwright browser navigation
**Result**: Failed with `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT`
- The Figma domain (figma.com) is blocked by the environment's firewall rules

### 3. Delegated to Shazam Custom Agent (Second Attempt)
**Result**: Failed - Agent experienced technical difficulties
- Error: "Failed to get response from the AI model; retried 5 times"

## Environment Configuration Observed
- `COPILOT_MCP_ENABLED=true` - MCP is enabled in the environment
- `COPILOT_AGENT_INJECTED_SECRET_NAMES=COPILOT_MCP_FIGMA_KEY` - A Figma API key is configured
- The actual Figma API key is not directly accessible as an environment variable (injected secret)

## Limitations Encountered
1. **Network Access**: Direct browser access to figma.com is blocked by firewall rules
2. **Custom Agent Issues**: The Shazam agent (which should have Figma MCP access) encountered technical errors
3. **API Access**: While a Figma API key appears to be configured, it's not directly accessible to make API calls

## Alternative Approaches Available
To successfully complete this task, one of the following would be needed:

1. **Manual Export**: 
   - Access the Figma board manually through a browser
   - Export or copy the content
   - Provide the content for formatting into a summary

2. **Figma API Access**:
   - Direct access to the Figma API token
   - Use curl or a similar tool to query the Figma REST API

3. **Custom Agent Resolution**:
   - Fix the technical issues with the Shazam agent
   - Re-attempt delegation to the agent with Figma MCP tools

4. **Firewall Configuration**:
   - Whitelist figma.com domain in the environment
   - Enable browser-based access to the Figma board

## Next Steps Required
The task cannot be completed automatically due to the limitations above. User intervention is required to either:
- Provide the Figma board contents manually
- Grant access to figma.com domain
- Resolve the Shazam agent technical issues
- Provide direct access to the Figma API credentials
