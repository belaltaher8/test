# Werewolves

A Poem Inspired by Issue #109

---

In shadows deep where moonlight gleams,  
The werewolves prowl through midnight dreams.  
With silver fur and eyes that glow,  
They hunt beneath the moon's pale show.

Through forests dark and mountains high,  
They howl their song unto the sky.  
A creature torn 'tween beast and man,  
Cursed to roam since time began.

When full moon rises, round and bright,  
The transformation comes at night.  
From human form to wolf they turn,  
With ancient hunger, fierce they burn.

But morning breaks with gentle light,  
And werewolves fade back from the night.  
Until the moon returns once more,  
To wake the beast that sleeps in lore.
