## A Poem About Werewolves

In moonlit nights when shadows creep,
And mortals lie in restless sleep,
The werewolves howl beneath the stars,
Their ancient curse, their silver scars.

Through darkened woods they roam and run,
Neither fully beast nor man, but one,
With eyes that gleam like amber fire,
They sing their wild, untamed desire.

When lunar light shines full and bright,
The transformation starts at night,
From human form to creature wild,
Nature's fierce and fearsome child.

They hunt in packs, they prowl alone,
Their haunting cries, their mournful tone,
The werewolves dance 'tween two worlds torn,
Until the breaking of the morn.
