## Issues Encountered

### 1. Domain Blocked
When attempting to access the Figma URL directly via browser automation:
```
Error: page.goto: net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT
```
The Figma domain (figma.com) is blocked in the sandboxed environment.

### 2. Custom Agent Tool Unavailable
The Shazam custom agent is described as having "Figma MCP which allows it to access & retrieve Figma resources & information", but when invoked:
- Reported only having access to `report_progress` tool
- No Figma MCP tools available in its toolset
- Unable to access Figma APIs or boards
- Missing authentication and integration capabilities

### 3. No Alternative Access Methods
- No Figma API credentials configured
- No file export of board content available
- No other tools available to access external Figma resources

## Solutions Required

To complete this task, one of the following is needed:

### Option 1: Enable Figma Access
- Unblock figma.com domain in the sandboxed environment
- Configure Figma API credentials
- Ensure proper authentication setup

### Option 2: Configure Shazam Agent
- Properly configure the Shazam custom agent with actual Figma MCP tools
- Ensure the agent has necessary Figma API access
- Verify agent has file manipulation tools (create, write, etc.)

### Option 3: Manual Content Provision
- Export the Figma board content manually
- Provide the content as text/JSON/markdown
- Agent can then create a formatted summary from provided content

## Next Steps

Please choose one of the above options to proceed with the task. Once access is enabled or content is provided, the summary can be created and added to this repository.
