## Team Culture Highlights

Ice breaker responses reveal creative and thoughtful team:
- "Porsche 911 Turbo S or Super sonic Jet"
- "A plate of warm chocolate chip cookies"

- "Old man's breath moss - it's moss that only grows in the cleanest air in rainforests"
- "Stuffed animal"
- "Something versatile, maybe like a plate bowl or a super functional bag / probably a radio"

The team shows strong appreciation for each other, welcomes questions, enjoys working together in person, and is actively working to improve processes while maintaining a positive culture.
