# Figma Board Summary Request

## Issue
Attempted to summarize the Figma board at:
https://www.figma.com/board/eW7FOoRkgHdc6jwbzsLG4M/Copilot-Extensibility-Team-Retro-7-23-2025--Copy-?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=IpimDz4uQPYqdD3u-0

**Status**: Access Denied (403 Forbidden)

## Problem
The Figma board is currently private or has restricted API access permissions. The Figma integration cannot access boards that are:
- Private without proper authentication
- Restricted from API access in sharing settings
- Not shared with "Anyone with the link" viewing permissions

## Solutions

### Option 1: Update Figma Board Permissions (Recommended)
1. Open the Figma board
2. Click the "Share" button in the top right
3. Change sharing settings to "Anyone with the link" with at least "can view" permissions
4. Ensure API access is enabled in the sharing settings
5. Re-run this request after updating permissions

### Option 2: Manual Export
1. Export the board content manually from Figma
2. Provide the content as text or images
3. Create a summary based on the exported content

### Option 3: Direct Content Sharing
If you have access to the board, you can:
- Copy the text content directly
- Take screenshots of the board
- Share the key points and themes from the retro meeting

## Next Steps
Please choose one of the above options and:
- Update the Figma board permissions for API access, OR
- Provide the board content through an alternative method

Once access is granted or content is provided, a comprehensive summary can be created and saved to this repository.
