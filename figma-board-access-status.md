## Access Attempts

### 1. Shazam Custom Agent (Figma MCP)
**Status**: ❌ Failed  
**Reason**: The Shazam agent does not have Figma MCP tools available in the current environment. It cannot authenticate or access Figma API endpoints.

### 2. Browser Navigation
**Status**: ❌ Blocked  
**Reason**: The Figma domain is blocked in the sandboxed environment (ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT). Direct browser access to Figma.com is not permitted.

### 3. Web Search
**Status**: ❌ Not Found  
**Reason**: The Figma board appears to be private and is not indexed or accessible through public search.

## What Would Be Needed

To successfully retrieve and summarize the Figma board contents, one of the following would be required:

1. **Figma API Access**: 
   - Personal Access Token for Figma API
   - Proper authentication credentials
   - API tool configured with these credentials

2. **Manual Export**:
   - Export the board content from Figma manually
   - Provide the exported content (JSON, text, or description)
   - Then a summary can be created from the exported data

3. **Domain Whitelist**:
   - Request access to figma.com domain in the sandboxed environment
   - This would allow browser-based access to the board

## Recommendations

**Option 1 - Manual Export (Fastest)**:
1. Open the Figma board in your browser
2. Take screenshots or export the board content
3. Provide the content description or screenshots
4. A summary document can then be created

**Option 2 - API Integration (Most Automated)**:
1. Generate a Figma Personal Access Token
2. Configure the environment with Figma API credentials
3. Re-run the task with proper authentication

**Option 3 - Share Public Link**:
1. Make the Figma board publicly accessible
2. Generate a public share link
3. Retry access (though browser access may still be blocked)

## Current Status

⏸️ **Task Paused** - Waiting for additional access or content to proceed.
