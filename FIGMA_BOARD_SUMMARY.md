## Board Sections Overview

### 1. Ice Breaker: "If you were an inanimate object, what would you be?"

A fun team bonding activity with creative responses:
- Porsche 911 Turbo S or Super sonic Jet
- A plate of warm chocolate chip cookies
- A versatile plate bowl or super functional bag (vs. reality: a radio)
- An enigmatic work of art with a dramatic finale
- A stuffed animal
- Old man's breath moss (grows only in pristine rainforest air)

  - Overall calming of on-call intensity

## 3. Challenges (What Lacked / Do Less)

*Note: This section was identified on the board but specific items were not captured in the detailed notes.*

---

## 4. Learnings, Questions, & Concerns

### Support & Escalations
- **Question:** Should team help with support escalations or is Tim handling these solo?
- **Suggestion:** GitHub Actions or Slack automation to create FR items
- **Challenge:** Tagged repeatedly for Blackbird/MCP issues
- **Identity Question:** Is it "Belal is The MCP Guy" vs. "Belal is on a team"?

### Communication Overload
- **DM Interrupts:** High volume of direct message interruptions
- **Slack Noise:** Difficulty keeping up with discussions
- **Missing Context:** Unclear who is in coding-agent-team channel and their relevance
- **Suggestion:** Use Slack AI for summarized recaps
- **Action Needed:** Route requests to public team channel to create issues instead

### Clarity & Planning
- **Progress on Vision:** Team has made improvements with planning/release issues/demo meetings, but questioning if everyone feels the same
- **DRI Ownership:** Still lack of clarity on who owns what, especially with external teams
- **Universe Launches:** Launch timelines still not solidified
- **GA Planning:** Curious about voice at the table for GA discussions and expected additional load
- **Offsite Planning:** When will the offsite be scheduled?

### Work Organization
- **Proxima Epic:** Burned out from month-long effort; epic wasn't organized well but happy it's landing
- **FR vs Feature Work:** Hold team accountable to solve FR issues, but feature work seems to get more "points"
- **Sessions Experience:** Feels like sessions experience getting preferential treatment as "shiny new toy"

### Available Resources
- **Universe Releases:** Starting to populate in release issues - search for 'universe release' label + Tim as author in github/releases
- **Coding-Agent-Team Channel:** It's the skip level channel + everyone working on CCA (One GitHub)
- **Offsite Timing:** Probably October, after Universe (TBD)

---

## 5. Action Items (Take Aways)

### Process Improvements
- **FR Backlog:** Refine FR backlog management
- **Roadmap Communication:** Provide high-level overview of what's coming in larger group meetings
- **Slack Management:** Try out tools to summarize Slack conversations
- **Interrupts:** Ask folks to create issues instead of interrupting
- **Channel Routing:** Route requests to public team channel to create issues

### Team Practices
- **Pairing:** Continue pairing (already doing)
- **Brown Bags:** Continue knowledge sharing sessions (already doing)
- **Communication:** Whole org running and communicating more clearly

### Documentation & Tooling
- **AI-Assisted Docs:** Assign Copilot to write docs on code (Cal's suggestion)

### Planning & Estimation
- **Time Management:** Be kind to yourself with timelines/estimates
- **Estimation Process:** Spend time in beginning to get accurate estimates
- **Avoid Over-Committing:** Better estimates will help prevent over-commitment

### Specific Follow-ups
- **Offsite Planning:** October timeframe (post-Universe), Tim working to finalize
- **Universe Preparation:** Next week or two for solidification
