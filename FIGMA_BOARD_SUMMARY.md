### ⚠️ NEGATIVES & CONCERNS (Lacked/Do Less)

#### Communication Overload

- **DM Interrupts**: Too many direct message interruptions disrupting focus
- **Missing Conversations**: Fear of missing important discussions in the noise
- Need for better summarization tools (Slack AI mentioned as potential solution)

#### Organizational Clarity
- **Support Escalations**: Unclear if Tim is solely handling these or if team should help as First Responders
- **DRI Confusion**: Still some lack of clarity on who owns what, especially with external teams
- **External Team Context**: Uncertainty about who is in the coding-agent-team channel and their relevance
- **Universe Launches**: Not yet solidified, needs better documentation (Tim working on it)

#### Resource Allocation & Burnout
- **Proxima Epic Management**: One team member "burned a candle at both ends" for over a month due to poor organization

#### Process Gaps
- **FR Backlog**: Needs refinement
- **GA Load Planning**: Questions about whether team had a voice in GA planning and expected additional load
- **High-Level Overviews**: Need for better high-level overview of what's coming in larger group meetings

#### Team Identity
- Question raised: "Do you think it's organizational? Belal is The MCP Guy vs. Belal is on a team"
- Suggests potential issues with how individuals vs. teams are perceived
