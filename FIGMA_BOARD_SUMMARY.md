# Figma Board Summary

## Board Information
- **Title**: Copilot Extensibility Team Retro 7-23-2025 - Copy
- **URL**: https://www.figma.com/board/eW7FOoRkgHdc6jwbzsLG4M/Copilot-Extensibility-Team-Retro-7-23-2025--Copy-?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=IpimDz4uQPYqdD3u-0

## Access Notes
The Figma board cannot be automatically fetched due to Figma's robots.txt restrictions. To summarize the board contents:

1. **Manual Access**: Open the Figma URL in a web browser with appropriate permissions
2. **Export Options**: Use Figma's built-in export features to save board contents
3. **API Access**: Consider using Figma's official API with proper authentication for programmatic access

## How to Summarize
When accessing the board manually, capture:
- Main sections and their organization
- Key sticky notes and comments
- Action items or decisions
- Team feedback themes
- Any diagrams or visual elements

## Future Improvements
To enable automated Figma board summarization:
- Set up Figma API authentication with personal access token
- Create a custom script or agent that uses the Figma REST API
- Store summaries in this repository for team reference
