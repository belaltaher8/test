## Main Sections

### 1. Ice Breaker: "If you were an inanimate object, what would you be?"

Creative team responses include:
- A versatile plate/bowl or functional bag (would like), but probably a radio
- An enigmatic work of art with a hundred-year museum run that ends in a large fire
- Porsche 911 Turbo S or Super sonic Jet
- A plate of warm chocolate chip cookies
- A stuffed animal
- Old man's breath moss (moss that only grows in cleanest air in rainforests)

### 2. Positives (What Went Well)

#### Team & People
- **Welcome Dan!** Multiple sticky notes celebrating Dan joining the team and his first gh/gh PR
- "Mentoring Dan has been a lot of fun"
- "Thanks everyone for allowing me to ask dumb questions / feel like a part of the team!!!"
- Emily, Brandyn, Ray, and Abhinav took someone in as a "fake seattlite" for a week
- Belal and teammate got happy hour in NYC and co-working space fun

#### Team Collaboration
- People pairing more on epics together this month
- Already pairing and doing brownbags

#### Technical Achievements
- Huge shout out to Brandyn, Kinsey and others for Proxima work and testing CCA surface areas
- "Brandyn is so great at writing code, devops, all the things"
- Shoutout to Ray for driving Job queuing work with Colby and ensuring readiness for GA

#### On-Call Improvements
- "On call feels getting better compared to a month ago"
- "on call feels less like a nightmare, thanks for all the work everyone's done shoring things up to be better!!!"
- "Oncall has seemed to calm down some"
- "only got paged once (and it was transient)"
- "on call less with new folks joining the rotation"

#### Leadership & Process
- "Excited to be a DRI on sunsetting extensions, I love breaking down tasks"
- "yay Emily - thanks for sunsetting extensions!!"
- "Cool that our new interim manager is Ray and not some rando"
- "Excited Ray is stepping in as our interim manager"
- "the agent-session-experience team seems to be developing and it's kind of nice to see some more structure for surrounding teams"

#### Team Culture
- "Nice to hear about the different vacations everyone is taking s/o to cool biking tours"

---

### 3. Learnings, Questions, Concerns

#### Support & Workload
- Support escalations? (seems like Tim is just doing these, should we help as FR, do we have bandwidth)?
- "i keep getting tagged to fix blackbird issues / MCP in general"
- Discussion about organizational perception: "Belal is The MCP Guy vs. Belal is on a team"

#### Clarity & Communication
- "Previously we've discussed lack of clarity on the next steps/vision. I think we've made improvements here with planning/release issues/demo meeting etc. Curious if folks feel the same? If not, what is missing?"
- "Can still be lack of clarity on DRI, who owns what especially with external teams?"
- "I have no idea who is in the coding-agent-team channel and their relevance, sometimes that context would be nice"
- Channel clarification: "It's our skip level channel ;) And everyone else working on CCA. One GitHub"

#### Slack & Communication Overload
- "lots of DM interrupts - maybe i just need to ignore people more"
- "No, there's definitely just a lot of slack noise"
- "So hard to keep up with discussions in Slack, etc. but feel like I am missing out on important conversations"
- Suggestions: "Maybe we needs Teams :haha Also have you checked out the Slack AI thing? It does give you summarized Recaps"
- "Please put me on the Slack AI methodology"

#### Workload & Burnout
- "Burned a candle at both ends for Proxima stuff for over a month. The whole epic wasn't organized well, but I'm happy it's landing."

#### Universe & Planning
- "Universe launches are still not solidified"
- Response: "We're starting to populate them in release issues. search for 'universe release' in the label + Tim as the author in github/releases"
- "curious if we've had a voice at the table when it comes to talk about going to GA - what's the additional load on the team expected?"

#### Offsite
- "When will our offsite be..."
- Answer: "October? But also maybe not just before universe. Basically TBD but probably after universe"

#### Team Priorities
- "Feels a little bit like the sessions experience is getting a lot of the shiny new toy"
- "hold ourselves accountable to actually solve FR issues and not feature work - but it feels like that work gets you less 'points'"

#### Automation
- "There are some good ways we could make this work better for us -- like have a github action that does something, like create a FR item. (Maybe slack???) Yes, I have written something that does something like that before lol."
- "We had something like this that automatically added the first responder label on the copilot-extensibility repo, and then a board that listed PRs and Issues with the label"

#### Brown Bags
- "Next brown bag topic"

---

### 4. Action Items / Take Aways

#### Process Improvements
- "refine FR backlog"
- "high-level overview of whats coming in larger group meetings"
  - Response: "Tim is working to set this in stone, should be next week or two"
- "try out tools to summarize slack?"
- "whole org running and communicating more clearly"

#### Team Practices
- "be kind to yourself with timelines / estimates (spend time in beginning to get estimate) - will help us avoid over-committing"

#### Communication Improvements
- "Ask folks to issues instead of interrupts"
- "route to public team channel to create issues"

#### Documentation
- "Assign copilot to write docs on our code (Cal)"

#### Already Happening
- "already pairing and doing brownbags"

## Overall Theme & Purpose

This retrospective board reveals a **team in transition** with several key themes:

1. **Growth & New Members**: The team is welcoming new member Dan and celebrating the positive onboarding experience.

2. **On-Call Relief**: Significant improvement in on-call burden thanks to team efforts and new rotation members.

3. **Technical Progress**: Major accomplishments including Proxima work, job queuing, and GA preparation.

4. **Communication Challenges**: Persistent issues with Slack noise, DM interrupts, and keeping up with discussions across multiple channels.

5. **Clarity Needs**: Ongoing need for better clarity on priorities, DRIs, external team interactions, and Universe launch plans.

6. **Work-Life Balance**: Recognition that intense efforts (like Proxima) led to burnout, with action items around better estimation and avoiding over-commitment.

7. **First Responder vs Feature Work**: Tension between FR responsibilities and feature work, with FR work feeling less valued.

8. **Leadership Transition**: Positive reception to Ray stepping in as interim manager.

The retro shows a healthy team culture willing to celebrate wins, acknowledge challenges, and propose concrete solutions. The tone is constructive and collaborative with appropriate humor mixed in.
