## ❓ Learnings, Questions, and Concerns

### Support & Escalations
- Questions about support escalations: Currently Tim is handling these alone - should First Responders help? Do they have bandwidth?

### Communication Challenges
- **High volume of DM interrupts** - significant concern across the team
- Acknowledged "Slack noise" problem affecting multiple team members
- Difficulty keeping up with important Slack discussions without feeling like they're missing critical conversations
- Suggestions: Consider using Slack AI for summarized recaps

### Workload & Focus
- Some team members keep getting tagged for Blackbird issues and MCP in general
- Proxima epic was intense, lasting over a month with both ends of the candle burning - organization could have been better, but happy it's landing
- Discussion about whether certain team members are seen as "The MCP Guy" vs being recognized as part of the team
- Perception that sessions experience work gets prioritized as "shiny new toy"
- **Challenge: Balancing First Responder (FR) issues with feature work** - FR work may get less recognition/"points"

### Clarity & Direction
- Previous concerns about lack of clarity on next steps/vision have improved with planning, release issues, and demo meetings - but there's room for more improvement
- Lack of clarity on DRIs and ownership, especially with external teams
- Uncertainty about who is in the coding-agent-team channel and their relevance - context would be helpful
  - Note: It's the skip level channel plus everyone else working on CCA (One GitHub)

### Product & Launch Concerns
- **Universe launches are still not solidified** (though they're being populated in release issues with "universe release" label)
- Concerns about whether the team has had sufficient voice in GA planning discussions
- Questions about expected additional load on the team when going to GA

### Process Improvements
- Ideas for automation: GitHub action to automatically create FR items, perhaps via Slack
- Previously had automation that added first responder labels on copilot-extensibility repo with board tracking
- Offsite timing questions: Likely October, but probably after Universe (not right before)
  - Tim is working to finalize dates in the next week or two
- Next brownbag topic needed

---

## 💡 Takeaways & Action Items

### Process & Workflow Improvements
- **Refine FR backlog**
- **Provide high-level overview of what's coming** in larger group meetings
- **Try out tools to summarize Slack** - reduce communication overload
- Improve organization-wide running and communication clarity
- **Ask folks to create issues instead of interrupts** - route requests to public team channel to create issues
- **Assign copilot to write docs on code** (Cal to lead)

### Time Management
- **Be kind to yourself with timelines/estimates** - spend time upfront to get accurate estimates to avoid over-committing

## 🎨 Icebreaker: If you were an inanimate object, what would you be?

Team responses showed creativity and personality:
- "Something versatile, maybe like a plate bowl or a super functional bag / What I would probably be: A radio"
- "An enigmatic and unique work of art with at least a hundred year run in a museum somewhere and then gets burned down in a large fire"
- "Porsche 911 Turbo S or Super sonic Jet"
- "A plate of warm chocolate chip cookies"
- "Stuffed animal"
- "Old man's breath moss - it's moss that only grows in the cleanest air in rainforests" ← Team favorite with great storyline
