## Ice Breaker: "If you were an inanimate object, what would you be?"

Team members shared creative responses:
- Someone would want to be something versatile like a plate, bowl, or super functional bag, but would probably be a radio
- A wish to be an enigmatic and unique work of art that runs in a museum for at least a hundred years and then gets burned down in a large fire
- Porsche 911 Turbo S or a supersonic jet
- A plate of warm chocolate chip cookies
- A stuffed animal
- Old man's breath moss (moss that only grows in the cleanest air in rainforests)

## Positives

**Team Highlights:**
- **Welcome Dan!** + kudos on his first gh/gh PR
- On-call feels getting better compared to a month ago
- People pairing more on epics together this month
- Huge shout out to Brandyn, Kinsey, and others who helped with the Proxima work and testing the surface areas of CCA
- On-call feels less like a nightmare thanks to everyone's work
- Excitement about being a DRI on sunsetting extensions
- Brandyn is great at writing code, devops, all the things
- Mentoring Dan has been fun
- Cool that the new interim manager is Ray and not some rando
- Only got paged once (and it was transient)
- Shoutout to Ray for driving the Job queuing work with Colby and ensuring readiness for GA
- On-call has calmed down
- Thanks everyone for allowing team members to ask dumb questions and feel like part of the team
- Excited Ray is stepping in as interim manager
- Nice to hear about different vacations (shoutout to cool biking tours)
- Belal and a teammate got to do happy hour in NYC and work together in a co-working space
- On-call less frequent with new folks joining the rotation
- Emily, Brandyn, Ray, and Abhinav took someone in as a "fake Seattleite" for a week
- The agent-session-experience team seems to be developing with more structure for surrounding teams

## Learnings, Questions, Concerns

**Key Topics Raised:**
- **Support escalations** - seems like Tim is just doing these; question about whether the team should help as FR and if there's bandwidth
- Question about improvements in clarity on next steps/vision with planning/release issues/demo meetings
- Suggestion for a GitHub action that creates FR items (maybe Slack integration)
- Lack of clarity on DRI - who owns what, especially with external teams
- Next brown bag topic discussion
- Lots of DM interrupts - maybe need to ignore people more
- Acknowledgment that there's definitely a lot of Slack noise
- Hard to keep up with discussions in Slack but feeling like missing important conversations
- Burned a candle at both ends for Proxima stuff for over a month; epic wasn't organized well but happy it's landing
- Keep getting tagged to fix Blackbird issues / MCP in general
- Suggestion about maybe needing Teams; also mention of Slack AI thing for summarized Recaps
- Previous automation existed that added first responder labels and created boards
- Question: is it organizational? "Belal is The MCP Guy vs. Belal is on a team"
- Request to learn about Slack AI methodology
- Universe launches are still not solidified
- No idea who is in the coding-agent-team channel and their relevance
- Curious if the team has had a voice at the table when talking about going to GA - what's the additional load expected?
- Note: Universe releases are starting to be populated in release issues (search for "universe release" in the label + Tim as author in github/releases)
- When will the offsite be?
- Note: coding-agent-team channel is the skip level channel and everyone else working on CCA (One GitHub)
- Feels like the sessions experience is getting a lot of the shiny new toy

## Lacked/Do Less (Negatives)

**Challenges Identified:**
- Need to hold ourselves accountable to solve FR issues and not just feature work - but it feels like that work gets fewer "points"
- Need to refine FR backlog
- Need high-level overview of what's coming in larger group meetings

---

## Take Aways

**Action Items & Solutions:**
- Tim is working to set Universe release schedule in stone, should be next week or two
- Try out tools to summarize Slack
- Whole org running and communicating more clearly
- Offsite timing: October? But maybe not just before Universe - basically TBD but probably after Universe
- Already pairing and doing brown bags
- Ask folks to create issues instead of interrupts
- Assign Copilot to write docs on our code (Cal)
- Route to public team channel to create issues
- Be kind to yourself with timelines/estimates (spend time in beginning to get estimate) - will help avoid over-committing

## Quick Tips / Helpful Tools

The board includes helpful FigJam tips:
- **Code blocks** - Add code snippets on canvas with 14 different syntax highlighting styles (shortcut: shift + I or click "More" in nav)
- **Navigating FigJam** - Pan around canvas with touchpad gestures or hold spacebar and drag (spacebar + drag)
- **Zoom in and out** - Use pinch gestures or hold command/ctrl while scrolling (⌘ (ctrl) + scroll)
- **Stickies** - Grab from toolbar or press "S" to add sticky notes
- **Open sessions** - Invite others without Figma accounts to edit board for up to 24 hours (Share button, top right)
- **Stamps** - Leave marks on canvas; set up avatar in user settings for avatar stamping (E to toggle, or click stamp icon)
