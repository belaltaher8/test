## Ice Breaker Question
**"If you were an inanimate object, what would you be?"**

Team responses included:
- A versatile plate/bowl or functional bag (but probably a radio)
- An enigmatic work of art with a 100-year museum run ending in a fire
- A Porsche 911 Turbo S or supersonic jet
- A plate of warm chocolate chip cookies
- A stuffed animal
- Old man's breath moss (grows only in the cleanest rainforest air)

## Positives (What Went Well)

### Team Celebrations:
- **Welcome Dan!** - New team member joined and already shipped a fast PR fix to gh/gh
- **On-call improvements** - Much better compared to a month ago, fewer nightmares, only got paged once (transient issue)
- **More pairing** - Team members pairing more on epics together this month
- **Proxima work** - Huge shoutout to Brandyn, Kinsey, and others for helping with Proxima work and testing CCA surface areas
- **Job queuing work** - Ray drove this work with Colby to ensure GA readiness with amazing progress
- **Team culture** - Welcoming atmosphere where new members feel comfortable asking questions
- **Brandyn's excellence** - Great at writing code, devops, and all technical areas
- **Leadership transition** - Ray stepping in as interim manager (familiar face, not a stranger)
- **Sunsetting extensions** - Emily taking DRI on this work and enjoying task breakdown
- **Mentoring** - Dan's mentorship has been fun
- **Team bonding** - NYC happy hour and co-working between Belal and team members, Seattle visit for fake Seattlite
- **Agent-session-experience team** - Structure developing for surrounding teams
- **Reduced on-call rotation** - Less frequent with new folks joining

## Questions, Learnings, and Concerns

### Key Topics:

1. **Support Escalations** - Concern that Tim is handling these alone; question about whether First Responders should help and if there's bandwidth

2. **Clarity on next steps/vision** - Progress made with planning/release issues/demo meetings, but team wants to confirm if everyone feels the same way

3. **External team coordination** - Lack of clarity on DRI and ownership with external teams

4. **Brown bag topics** - Discussion about next session topic

5. **DM interrupts** - Lots of Slack interruptions; suggestion to ignore more or use automation tools

6. **Slack noise** - Confirmed issue across the team; hard to keep up with important discussions

7. **Proxima epic organization** - Burned candle at both ends for over a month; epic wasn't well organized but happy it's landing

8. **MCP ownership** - One team member keeps getting tagged to fix Blackbird issues/MCP in general; question about whether it's organizational (being "The MCP Guy" vs being on a team)

9. **Universe launches** - Still not solidified

10. **coding-agent-team channel** - Unclear who's in the channel and their relevance; context would be helpful

11. **GA load expectations** - Question about whether team has had a voice at the table regarding additional load expectations

12. **Offsite timing** - When will it be? (Answer: October maybe, probably after Universe, TBD)

13. **Sessions experience** - Feels like getting a lot of the "shiny new toy" attention

14. **FR issue accountability** - Need to hold ourselves accountable to solve FR issues vs feature work; FR work feels like it gets fewer "points"

## Action Items and Suggestions

### Process Improvements:
- **Support escalation automation** - Create GitHub action or Slack bot to route support issues (first responder label system previously existed on copilot-extensibility repo)
- **Refine FR backlog**
- **High-level overview in larger group meetings**
- **Try Slack AI summarization tools**
- **Ask folks to create issues instead of direct interrupts**
- **Route requests to public team channel to create issues**
- **Assign Copilot to write docs on code** (Cal's suggestion)
- **Be kind with timelines/estimates** - spend time upfront to avoid over-committing
- **Continue pairing and brown bags** (already happening)
- **Ensure whole org is running and communicating more clearly**

### Context Notes:
- Universe releases are being populated in release issues (search for "universe release" label with Tim as author in github/releases)
- Offsite timing confirmed: October, but TBD and probably after Universe
- Coding-agent-team channel is the skip-level channel plus everyone working on CCA at GitHub
- Tim is working to solidify certain items within the next week or two

## Summary

This retrospective shows a team in transition with positive momentum (new member onboarding, improved on-call, successful Proxima delivery) while managing growing pains around communication overhead, cross-team coordination, and balancing feature work with operational responsibilities.
