## 🎉 Ice Breaker: If you were an inanimate object, what would you be?

Team members shared creative responses:
- **Versatile plate/bowl or functional bag** (though realistically: a radio)
- **Enigmatic work of art** - something unique displayed in a museum for 100 years, then burned in a fire
- **Porsche 911 Turbo S or Super Sonic Jet**
- **Warm chocolate chip cookies**
- **Stuffed animal**
- **Old man's breath moss** - moss that only grows in the cleanest air in rainforests

## ✅ Positives

### Team Member Celebrations
- **WELCOME DAN!!** + kudos on your first gh/gh PR!
- Mentoring Dan has been a lot of fun
- Welcome Dan - already hitting it out of the park with a fast PR fix!
- Thanks everyone for allowing me to ask dumb questions / feel like a part of the team!!! (Dan)

### Team Collaboration
- People pairing more on epics together this month - love this!!!
- Already pairing and doing brownbags
- Belal and I got to do happy hour in NYC, working together in a co-working space was sooo fun!!
- Emily, Brandyn, Ray, and Abhinav took me in as a fake seattilite for a week and that was awesome

### On-Call Improvements
- On call feels getting better compared to a month ago
- On call feels less like a nightmare, thanks for all the work everyone's done shoring things up to be better!!!
- Oncall has seemed to calm down some
- Only got paged once (and it was transient)
- On call less with new folks joining the rotation

### Project Accomplishments
- **Huge shout out to Brandyn, Kinsey and others** who helped with the proxima work and testing the surface areas of CCA. Great job team, a lot went into it.
- **Shoutout to Ray** for driving the Job queuing work with Colby and ensuring we are ready for GA in general. Amazing progress there.
- Yay Emily - thanks for sunsetting extensions!!
- Excited to be a DRI on sunsetting extensions, I love breaking down tasks (I think)

### Team & Leadership
- Brandyn is so great at writing code, devops, all the things
- Cool that our new interim manager is Ray and not some rando I have to get used to complaining to in 1-1
- Excited Ray is stepping in as our interim manager
- Nice to hear about the different vacations everyone is taking - s/o to cool biking tours
- The agent-session-experience team seems to be developing and it's kind of nice to see some more structure for surrounding teams

## ⚠️ Learnings, Questions, Concerns

### Support & Escalations
- Support escalations? (seems like Tim is just doing these, should we help as FR, do we have bandwidth)?
- Previously we've discussed lack of clarity on the next steps/vision. Think we've made improvements here with planning/release issues/demo meeting etc. Curious if folks feel the same? If not, what is missing?

### Communication Challenges
- Lots of DM interrupts - maybe I just need to ignore people more
- No, there's definitely just a lot of slack noise
- So hard to keep up with discussions in Slack, etc. but feel like I am missing out on important conversations
- Maybe we need Teams :haha Also have you checked out the Slack AI thing? It does give you summarized Recaps

### Organizational Clarity
- Can still be lack of clarity on DRI, who owns what especially with external teams?
- I have no idea who is in the coding-agent-team channel and their relevance, sometimes that context would be nice
  - *Response: It's our skip level channel ;) And everyone else working on CCA. One GitHub*

### Workload & Burnout
- Burned a candle at both ends for Proxima stuff for over a month. The whole epic wasn't organized well, but I'm happy it's landing.
- I keep getting tagged to fix blackbird issues / MCP in general
  - *Do you think it's organizational? Belal is The MCP Guy vs. Belal is on a team*

### Release Planning
- Universe launches are still not solidified
  - *Response: We're starting to populate them in release issues. search for "universe release" in the label + Tim as the author in github/releases*
- Curious if we've had a voice at the table when it comes to talk about going to GA - what's the additional load on the team expected?

### Team Events
- When will our offsite be...
  - *October? But also maybe not just before universe. Basically TBD but probably after universe*
  - *Tim is working to set this in stone, should be next week or two*

### Work Prioritization
- Feels a little bit like the sessions experience is getting a lot of the shiny new toy
- Hold ourselves accountable to actually solve FR issues and not feature work - but it feels like that work gets you less "points"

### Other Questions
- Next brown bag topic

## 🎯 Take Aways (Action Items)

### Process Improvements
- **Refine FR backlog**
- **High-level overview of what's coming in larger group meetings**
- **Try out tools to summarize slack?**
- **Ask folks to issues instead of interrupts**
- **Route to public team channel to create issues**
- **Be kind to yourself with timelines / estimates** (spend time in beginning to get estimate) - will help us avoid over-committing

### Automation Ideas
- There are some good ways we could make this work better for us -- like have a github action that does something, like create a FR item. (Maybe slack???)
  - *Yes, I have written something that does something like that before lol*
- We had something like this that automatically added the first responder label on the copilot-extensibility repo, and then a board that listed PRs and Issues with the label

### Documentation
- Assign copilot to write docs on our code (Cal)

### Organizational
- Whole org running and communicating more clearly
- Already pairing and doing brownbags

### Areas for Improvement
- **Communication overload** - Slack DMs and channel noise making it hard to track important conversations
- **Organizational clarity** - Better definition of DRIs and ownership, especially with external teams
