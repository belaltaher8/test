## Overview

This retrospective captures the Copilot Extensibility Team's reflections, celebrating wins around team onboarding, improved on-call experience, and successful project deliveries, while addressing challenges related to communication overhead, workload distribution, and organizational clarity.

## Ice Breaker: "If you were an inanimate object, what would you be?"

Team members shared creative responses:
- A versatile plate/bowl or functional bag, but probably a radio
- An enigmatic work of art that runs for 100 years in a museum then burns down in a fire
- A Porsche 911 Turbo S or supersonic jet
- A plate of warm chocolate chip cookies
- A stuffed animal
- Old man's breath moss (moss that only grows in the cleanest air in rainforests)

## Positives & Wins

### Team Welcome & Onboarding
- **WELCOME DAN!!** Multiple team members celebrated Dan's arrival and first GitHub PR
- "Thanks everyone for allowing me to ask dumb questions / feel like a part of the team!!!"
- "welcome Dan we're so glad you're here! and already hitting it out of the park with a fast PR fix!"
- "Mentoring Dan has been a lot of fun"

### On-Call Improvements
- On-call experience significantly improved compared to a month ago
- "on call feels less like a nightmare, thanks for all the work everyone's done shoring things up to be better!!!"
- "Oncall has seemed to calm down some"
- "only got paged once (and it was transient)"
- Less on-call duty with new team members joining the rotation

### Team Collaboration
- "People pairing more on epics together this month, love this!!!"
- "Brandyn is so great at writing code, devops, all the things"
- "Huge shout out to Brandyn, Kinsey and others who helped with the proxima work and testing the surface areas of CCA. Great job team, a lot went into it!"
- "Belal and I got to do happy hour in NYC, working together in a co working space was sooo fun!!"
- "Emily, Brandyn, Ray, and Abhinav took me in as a fake seattilite for a week and that was awesome"

### Leadership & Project Work
- "Excited to be a DRI on sunsetting extensions, I love breaking down tasks (I think)"
- "yay Emily - thanks for sunsetting extensions!!"
- "Shoutout to Ray for driving the Job queuing work with Colby and ensuring we are ready for GA in general! We have made some amazing progress there!"
- "Cool that our new interum manager is Ray and not some rando I have to get used to complaining to in 1-1"
- "Excited Ray is stepping in as our interim manager"

### Team Culture
- "Nice to hear about the different vacations everyone is taking s/o to cool biking tours"
- "the agent-session-exerpience team seems to be developing and it's kind of nice to see some more structure for surrounding teams"

---

## Challenges & Areas to Improve (Lacked/Do Less)

### Communication & Clarity
- "Support escalations? (seems like Tim is just doing these, should we help as FR, do we have bandwidth)?"
- "Can still be lack of clarity on DRI, who owns what especially with external teams?"
- "I have no idea who is in the coding-agent-team channel and their relevance, sometimes that context would be nice"

### Workload & Interruptions
- "lots of DM interrupts - maybe i just need to ignore people more"
- "No, there's definitely just a lot of slack noise"
- "So hard to keep up with discussions in Slack, etc! but feel like I am missing out on important conversations"
- "i keep getting tagged to fix blackbird issues / MCP in general"
- "Burned a candle at both ends for Proxima stuff for over a month! The whole epic wasn't organized well, but I'm happy it's landing!"

### Process & Planning
- "Universe launches are still not solidified"
- "curious if we've had a voice at the table when it comes to talk about going to GA - what's the additional load on the team expected?"
- "Feels a little bit like the sessions experience is getting a lot of the shiny new toy"
- "hold ourselves accountable to actually solve FR issues and not feature work - but it feels like that work gets you less 'points'"

### Organizational Issues
- "Do you think it's organizational? Belal is The MCP Guy vs! Belal is on a team"

## Learnings, Questions & Action Items

### Questions Raised
- **Next brown bag topic**: What should the team focus on next?
- **Offsite timing**: "When will our offsite be..."
  - *Response*: "Tim is working to set this in stone, should be next week or two" / "October? But also maybe not just before universe! Basically TBD but probably after universe"
- **Vision clarity**: "Previously we've discussed lack of clarity on the next steps/vision! I think we've made improvements here with planning/release issues/demo meeting etc! Curious if folks feel the same? If not, what is missing?"

### Action Items & Solutions
- **Refine FR backlog** - Better organize first responder work
- **High-level overview** in larger group meetings for better context
- **Try out tools to summarize slack** - Address information overload
- **Ask folks to create issues instead of interrupts** - Reduce DM noise
- **Route to public team channel** to create issues for better tracking
- **Assign copilot to write docs on our code** (Cal) - Improve documentation
- **Already pairing and doing brownbags** - Continue these practices
- **Whole org running and communicating more clearly**
- **Be kind to yourself with timelines/estimates** - Spend time in beginning to get accurate estimates, avoid over-committing

### Automation Suggestions
- "There are some good ways we could make this work better for us -- like have a github action that does something, like create a FR item! (Maybe slack???)"
- "We had something like this that automatically added the first responder label on the copilot-extensibility repo, and then a board that listed PRs and Issues with the label"

### Channel Context Clarifications
- **coding-agent-team channel**: "It's our skip level channel ;)! And everyone else working on CCA! One GitHub"
- **Universe releases**: "We're starting to populate them in release issues! search for 'universe release' in the label + Tim as the author in github/releases"

### Helpful Tips Shared
- **Slack AI**: "Maybe we needs Teams :haha Also have you checked out the Slack AI thing? It does give you summarized Recaps"
- "Please put me on the Slack AI methodology"
