## Overview

This document summarizes the Copilot Extensibility Team retrospective held on August 20, 2025. The retrospective board serves as a collaborative space for team members to reflect on their recent sprint, share feedback, celebrate wins, identify challenges, and discuss improvements.

## Board Structure

The retrospective is organized into five main sections:

1. **Quick Tips & Helpful Tools** - FigJam usage tutorial
2. **Ice Breaker** - Team building activity
3. **Positives** - Celebrating wins and positive experiences
4. **Lacked/Do Less (Negatives)** - Areas of concern
5. **Learnings, Questions, Concerns** - Open questions and discussion topics
6. **Take Aways** - Action items and conclusions

## Team Ice Breaker

**Question:** "If you were an inanimate object, what would you be?"

Creative responses included:
- "A plate of warm chocolate chip cookies"
- "Porsche 911 Turbo S or Super sonic Jet"
- "A stuffed animal"
- "Old man's breath moss (moss that only grows in cleanest air in rainforests)"
- "A work of art that has at least a hundred year run in a museum then gets burned down in a large fire"

## 🎉 Positives & Wins

### New Team Member
- **WELCOME DAN!!** Multiple team members celebrated Dan joining the team
- "Kudos on your first gh/gh pr!"
- "Mentoring Dan has been a lot of fun"

### On-Call Improvements
- "On call feels getting better compared to a month ago"
- "Less like a nightmare"
- "On call less with new folks joining the rotation"

### Team Collaboration
- "People pairing more on epics together this month, love this!!!"
- "Belal and I got to do happy hour in NYC, working together in a co-working space was sooo fun!!"
- "Emily, Brandyn, Ray, and Abhinav took me in as a fake Seattleite for a week and that was awesome"

### Project Successes
- **Proxima Work:** "Huge shout out to Brandyn, Kinsey and others who helped with the proxima work and testing"
- **Job Queuing:** "Shoutout to Ray for driving the Job queuing work with Colby"

### Leadership
- "Excited Ray is stepping in as our interim manager"

## ⚠️ Concerns & Challenges

### Communication Overload
- "Lots of DM interrupts - maybe I just need to ignore people more"
- "So hard to keep up with discussions in Slack, etc. but feel like I am missing out on important conversations"
- "No, there's definitely just a lot of slack noise"

### Clarity Issues
- "Can still be lack of clarity on DRI, who owns what especially with external teams?"
- "I have no idea who is in the coding-agent-team channel and their relevance"

### Workload & Burnout
- "Burned a candle at both ends for Proxima stuff for over a month. The whole epic wasn't organized well, but I'm happy it's landing"
- "I keep getting tagged to fix blackbird issues / MCP in general" - Discussion about whether this is organizational ("Belal is The MCP Guy vs. Belal is on a team")

### Process Concerns
- **Support Escalations:** "Support escalations? (seems like Tim is just doing these, should we help as FR, do we have bandwidth)?"
- **Universe Launches:** "Universe launches are still not solidified"
- **GA Concerns:** "Curious if we've had a voice at the table when it comes to talk about going to GA - what's the additional load on the team expected?"

### Work Balance
- "Feels a little bit like the sessions experience is getting a lot of the shiny new toy"
- "Hold ourselves accountable to actually solve FR issues and not feature work - but it feels like that work gets you less 'points'"

## ✅ Action Items & Solutions

### For Support
- Refine FR backlog

### For Communication
- Try out tools to summarize Slack (Slack AI suggested)
- Ask folks to create issues instead of interrupts
- Route to public team channel to create issues

### For Clarity
- Provide high-level overview of what's coming in larger group meetings
- Whole org running and communicating more clearly

### For Team Building
- **Offsite:** Tim is working to set this in stone, should be next week or two
  - Timing: October (but maybe not just before Universe, basically TBD but probably after Universe)

### For Collaboration
- Already pairing and doing brownbags (continuing)

### For Documentation
- Assign Copilot to write docs on our code (Cal)

### For Planning
- Be kind to yourself with timelines/estimates
- Spend time in the beginning to get estimates
- Will help us avoid over-committing

### For Automation
- Discussion about creating GitHub actions for first responder workflows

## Overall Team Sentiment

The retrospective reveals a team with **strong positive momentum** and cohesion:
- Welcoming and supportive culture (evident in Dan's onboarding)
- Improvements in on-call experience
- Strong collaboration and pairing
- Proactive about addressing challenges

**Key Challenges Being Addressed:**
- Communication overload and Slack noise
- Need for better clarity on ownership and direction
- Balancing FR work with feature development
- Avoiding burnout through better planning and estimation

The team is actively working on concrete solutions to address these concerns, demonstrating a mature and self-aware engineering culture.
