## Access Issue

Unfortunately, the Figma board could not be accessed automatically due to permission restrictions. The API returned a **403 Forbidden** error, indicating that the board is not publicly accessible.

## How to Enable Access

To allow automated access to this Figma board, please follow these steps:

### Option 1: Make the File Publicly Viewable
1. Open the Figma file
2. Click the **Share** button (top right)
3. Change sharing settings to **"Anyone with the link"**
4. Set permissions to **"can view"**
5. Copy the updated link

### Option 2: Share with Specific Access
If you have a Figma API token with access to this file:
1. Ensure the token has appropriate read permissions
2. Verify the file is shared with the account associated with the token

### Option 3: Manual Summary
If the board contains sensitive information that cannot be made public:
1. Take screenshots of key sections
2. Export the board content as PDF or images
3. Manually extract and document the key points

## What We Expected to Extract

Once access is granted, we would be able to summarize:
- Main topics and themes from the retrospective
- Key feedback points (What went well, What to improve, Action items)
- Any sticky notes, comments, or annotations
- Visual elements and their organization
- Action items and next steps identified by the team

## Next Steps

Please update the Figma board's sharing permissions and we can retry fetching the summary, or provide the content through an alternative method.
