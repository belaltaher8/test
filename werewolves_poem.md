# A Poem About Issue 109: Werewolves

In shadows deep where moonlight gleams,
A tale unfolds of haunted dreams,
Issue one-oh-nine, so stark and bold,
A single word, a story told.

**Werewolves.**

Creatures of the night they roam,
Neither beast nor man alone,
Cursed to walk 'tween two dark roads,
Bearing transformation's heavy loads.

When silver moon hangs full and bright,
The change begins with piercing fright,
Bones that crack and muscles tear,
Sprouting forth with midnight hair.

In GitHub's realm, this issue stands,
A cryptic note from typing hands,
Just "werewolves" typed, no more, no less,
A mystery for us to guess.

Are they hunted? Do they hunt?
Do they rage or simply grunt?
The issue speaks in words so few,
Yet conjures legends old and new.

Perhaps it's simple, perhaps it's deep,
A placeholder for those who sleep,
Or maybe just a playful jest,
A werewolf howl, a coding test.

So here's to issue one-oh-nine,
Where werewolves lurk in every line,
A tribute paid in verse and rhyme,
To creatures lost between two times.
