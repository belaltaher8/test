A Digital Ode

In circuits deep and code so bright,
Where logic flows through day and night,
A repository stands with grace,
A digital and creative space.

Through branches green and commits true,
Each line of work brings something new,
Collaborators near and far,
Together reach for every star.

With pull requests and issues clear,
Solutions find their way right here,
From bugs to features, all take part,
In this grand symphony of art.

So let us code with passion strong,
And write our programs all day long,
For in this world of ones and zeros,
We all become our own code heroes.
