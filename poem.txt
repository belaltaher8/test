A Nice Poem

In the realm of code where logic flows,
Where algorithms dance and knowledge grows,
A digital garden begins to bloom,
Dispelling shadows, banishing gloom SHAZAM!

Lines of text like verses rhyme,
Each commit a moment frozen in time,
Branches weave tales both old and new,
In this repository, dreams come true SHAZAM!

From pull requests to issues clear,
Collaboration brings us near,
Together we build, together we code,
Walking down this creative road SHAZAM!

So here's a poem, simple and bright,
To bring some joy and pure delight,
May it remind you as you explore,
That beauty lives in every core SHAZAM!
