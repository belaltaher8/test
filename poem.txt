A Digital Dream

In circuits deep and code so bright,
Where logic flows through day and night,
A spark of wonder takes its flight,
And paints the darkness into light.

Through silicon valleys, data streams,
Computing power fuels our dreams,
Binary stars in endless gleams,
Nothing is quite as it seems.

With every keystroke, worlds unfold,
Stories written, tales retold,
Innovation, brave and bold,
More precious than any gold.

From humble code to grand design,
Where human heart and tech combine,
Creation's dance, so pure, divine,
In every loop and every line.

So here we stand at progress' door,
With tools we've never had before,
To learn, to build, to dream, explore,
And reach for heights we can't ignore.

For in this age of ones and zeros,
We all can be tomorrow's heroes,
Breaking through whatever barriers,
Building bridges, being bearers.

Of hope and change and futures bright,
Where wrong transforms into what's right,
And every challenge we must fight,
Becomes a step toward the light.
