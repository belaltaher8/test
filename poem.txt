A Poem of Code and Dreams

In digital gardens where ideas bloom bright,
Lines of code dance through the night,
Each function crafted with tender care,
Algorithms floating through the air.

Brackets embrace like loving arms,
Variables hold their simple charms,
Loops that spiral, infinite and free,
Creating worlds for all to see.

Bugs may hide in shadows deep,
While developers their vigils keep,
But when the tests all turn to green,
The sweetest victory ever seen.

From humble commits, great projects grow,
Through merge requests, the rivers flow,
Collaboration's gentle art,
Where strangers share a common heart.

So here's to those who build and dream,
Who debug life's recursive scheme,
In every keystroke, every line,
A touch of something quite divine.

For code is poetry in disguise,
A language where the spirit flies,
And in this test repo we find,
The beauty of the coding mind.
