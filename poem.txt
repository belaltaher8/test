A Magical Journey

In fields of wonder where dreams take flight,
I found a spark that glowed so bright SHAZAM!

The stars above would dance and sing,
As magic flowed through everything SHAZAM!

With every step, a new surprise,
A world of joy before my eyes SHAZAM!

The mountains tall, the rivers wide,
All nature's beauty stood with pride SHAZAM!

Through storm and sun, through night and day,
This enchantment would never fade away SHAZAM!

So let us cherish moments dear,
And hold the magic ever near SHAZAM!

For in our hearts, the power lies,
To make our wildest dreams arise SHAZAM!
