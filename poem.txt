A Beautiful Poem

In gardens where the wild roses grow,
Where morning dew makes petals glow,
The gentle breeze whispers through the trees,
And carries songs upon the breeze.

The sun ascends with golden rays,
Painting colors through the days,
While clouds drift by like ships at sea,
In endless sky, so wild and free.

The stars at night, they shine so bright,
Like diamonds scattered in the night,
The moon above, a silver sphere,
Brings peace and calm when it appears.

Through seasons change and years go by,
The beauty lives beneath the sky,
In every moment, big or small,
There's magic waiting for us all.

So take a breath and look around,
At wonders that can still be found,
For life's a poem, verse by verse,
A gift throughout this universe.
