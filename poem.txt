A Beautiful Poem

In lines of code, where logic flows with grace,
A repository stands, a digital space,
Where dreams are built with keystrokes, one by one,
And brilliant minds combine till work is done, SHAZAM!

Each commit tells a story, each branch a path,
Through algorithms, functions, and their math,
The pull requests merge like rivers to the sea,
Creating software for all humanity, SHAZAM!

From morning light to stars that shine at night,
Developers craft solutions, burning bright,
With passion, skill, and teamwork intertwined,
They shape the future of the digital mind, SHAZAM!

So here's to code, to bugs that we debug,
To coffee cups and each collaborative hug,
May every line you write be clean and true,
And may your tests all pass when you are through, SHAZAM!

In this vast world of zeroes and of ones,
Where innovation never quite is done,
Remember that behind each line of code,
There beats a heart upon this creative road, SHAZAM!
