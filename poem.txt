A Digital Dream

In circuits deep and code so bright,
Where bits and bytes dance through the night,
A repository waits with patient grace,
For words to fill its empty space SHAZAM!

Through GitHub's halls and branches wide,
Where developers commit with pride,
We weave our tales in lines of verse,
Expanding the digital universe SHAZAM!

The pull requests flow like streams of thought,
Each merge a lesson dearly taught,
In collaboration's gentle embrace,
We build together, face to face SHAZAM!

So here's to code and poetry alike,
Where creativity and logic strike,
A balance perfect, strong and true,
Creating wonders, me and you SHAZAM!
