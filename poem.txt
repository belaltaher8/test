Whispers of Dawn

In the quiet hush before the day is born,
When stars still linger in the fading night,
The world holds breath, suspended and forlorn,
Awaiting that first gentle stroke of light.

The dewdrops catch the promise of the sun,
Like diamonds scattered on the emerald grass,
While songbirds greet what darkness has undone,
Their melodies a bridge from what has passed.

The morning mist rises soft and slow,
A silver veil that dances through the trees,
And in this stillness, hearts begin to know
The whispered secrets carried on the breeze.

For every dawn brings gifts we cannot see,
A chance to write our stories once again,
To shed the weight of who we used to be,
And find the courage dwelling deep within.

So let us greet this day with open arms,
Embrace the light that breaks through every seam,
And trust that life, with all its gentle charms,
Is far more beautiful than any dream.
