A Digital Dream

In circuits deep and code so bright,
Where logic flows through endless night,
A spark of thought begins to gleam,
A whisper of a digital dream.

Through loops and functions, swift and true,
The world transforms in ones and twos,
Each line a verse, each bug a test,
In this pursuit, we give our best.

The screen glows soft with morning light,
Ideas bloom from dark to bright,
With every keystroke, worlds we make,
New paths to forge, new ground to break.

Though silicon may guide the way,
It's human hearts that shape the day,
In code and art, we find our voice,
In creation, we rejoice.

So here's to dreamers, far and wide,
Who in their craft take endless pride,
May inspiration never cease,
And may your code compile in peace.
