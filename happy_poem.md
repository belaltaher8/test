# A Happy Poem

The sun shines bright on this lovely day,
Birds are singing in their cheerful way,
Flowers bloom with colors so bright,
Everything feels perfectly right!

Smiles and laughter fill the air,
Joy and kindness everywhere,
Friends and family gather near,
Spreading love and banishing fear.

The world is full of wonder true,
With endless possibilities for me and you,
So let your heart be light and free,
And dance with pure felicity!

Life is beautiful, can't you see?
Embrace each moment with glee,
For happiness is not far away,
It's here with us every single day!
