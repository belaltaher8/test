# A Happy Poem

Sunshine streaming through the trees,
Dancing with the gentle breeze,
Laughter echoes, hearts are light,
Everything just feels so right.

Flowers blooming all around,
Joyful music, happy sound,
Smiles that brighten up the day,
Chasing all the clouds away.

Friends together, hand in hand,
Life is truly something grand,
Every moment, every hour,
Filled with beauty, love, and power.

So let's celebrate with glee,
All the wonder we can see,
Life is precious, life is bright,
Full of hope and pure delight!

Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!
