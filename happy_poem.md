The sun shines bright on this beautiful day SHAZAM!
Birds are singing in their cheerful way SHAZAM!
Flowers bloom with colors so divine SHAZAM!
Everything around us seems to shine SHAZAM!

Laughter fills the air with joyous sound SHAZAM!
Friends and family gather all around SHAZAM!
Smiles spread like sunshine on each face SHAZAM!
Happiness fills up this wonderful place SHAZAM!

Children play with giggles and delight SHAZAM!
Their innocent joy makes everything bright SHAZAM!
Love surrounds us like a warm embrace SHAZAM!
Life is good in this magical space SHAZAM!

So let's celebrate with hearts so free SHAZAM!
Dancing under our favorite tree SHAZAM!
For every moment brings us something new SHAZAM!
And happiness will always see us through SHAZAM!
