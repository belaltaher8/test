# A Poem for You

In lines of code, we find our way,
Through logic gates, both night and day.
Each function calls, each loop it spins,
A dance of ones where magic begins.

The bugs we chase, the tests we write,
Debug with patience, through the night.
Commit by commit, we build and grow,
Creating worlds that only we know.

So here's to coders, far and wide,
Who type with passion, hearts open wide.
In every keystroke, dreams take flight,
Turning darkness into light.
