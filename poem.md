# A Quiet Moment

The morning light slips through the leaves,
A golden thread on dewy grass,
The wind hums softly through the trees
And stirs the world as hours pass.

A sparrow sings upon the bough,
Its melody both clear and bright,
As if it knew, some way, somehow,
That song alone makes the world right.

The river winds through stone and reed,
Patient, steady, always there,
It asks for nothing, feels no need,
Just moves through sunlight, fog, and air.

And so I sit beside this stream,
And watch the day unfold and grow,
Content to breathe, content to dream,
And simply let the moments flow.
