# A Coder's Verse

In silicon dreams where logic flows,
Through circuits bright where data goes,
A world of ones and zeros dance,
In electric light's eternal trance.

The keyboard clicks, a rhythmic song,
As lines of code grow swift and long,
From nothing blooms a digital art,
Where creativity and logic start.

Through bugs and errors, still we stride,
With patience as our faithful guide,
For in each problem lies the key,
To unlock solutions, wild and free.

So here's to those who build and make,
Who code through night for passion's sake,
In every function, loop, and line,
A spark of human will divine.
