# A Journey Through Seasons

In spring's gentle embrace, the world awakes,
With blossoms bright and morning dew on lakes.
The birds return with melodies so sweet,
As nature stirs beneath our wandering feet.

Summer sun blazes high across the sky,
While children laugh and golden days drift by.
The warmth of life flows through each living thing,
As creatures dance and distant church bells ring.

When autumn paints the leaves in rust and gold,
A harvest of stories, both new and old.
The crisp air whispers secrets to the trees,
As they prepare for winter's coming freeze.

And winter comes with snow so pure and white,
Transforming everything beneath moonlight.
Though cold may reign and darkness falls so soon,
The promise of new spring lies beneath the moon.

Through every season, through each passing year,
We find that hope and beauty always near.
For life's great cycle teaches us to know,
That after every winter, flowers grow.
