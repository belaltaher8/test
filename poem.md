# A Nice Poem

In lines of code, where logic flows,
A garden of functions beautifully grows,
With loops that dance and variables sing,
Each commit we make, new wonders bring.

Through bugs and errors, we persist,
With patience strong, we coexist,
Debugging late into the night,
Until our tests all shine so bright.

The pull requests come and go,
Reviews help our knowledge grow,
In this repo, side by side,
We build together with great pride.

So here's to code both clean and clear,
To collaboration we hold dear,
May our builds all pass with grace,
As we improve this digital space.
