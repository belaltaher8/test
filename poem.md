# A Nice Poem

## Whispers of Wonder

In gardens where the morning dew glistens like diamonds SHAZAM!
The sun awakens with a golden embrace, painting the sky with hues of amber and rose SHAZAM!
Birds sing their melodies, each note a gift to the awakening world SHAZAM!

Through meadows green and valleys wide, where wildflowers dance in gentle breeze SHAZAM!
The earth itself seems to breathe with life, pulsing with ancient rhythms SHAZAM!
Mountains stand as silent guardians, watching over all with steadfast grace SHAZAM!

Rivers flow like liquid music, carrying stories from distant lands SHAZAM!
Each droplet holds a memory, each current whispers secrets of the deep SHAZAM!
The water reflects the endless sky, creating mirrors of infinite blue SHAZAM!

In this world of endless beauty, we find our hearts can truly soar SHAZAM!
Every moment holds a treasure, every breath a chance to wonder more SHAZAM!
For in the simple act of living, we discover magic everywhere SHAZAM!

Let us cherish these precious moments, these gifts that nature freely gives SHAZAM!
In the symphony of existence, we are both the music and the dance SHAZAM!

Why don't poets ever get speeding tickets? Because they always know how to meter their pace!
