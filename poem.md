# A Digital Ode

In circuits deep and code so bright,
Where bits and bytes dance through the night,
A world of logic, pure and true,
Where ones and zeros dream anew.

The cursor blinks with patient grace,
As keystrokes fill the empty space,
Each function, loop, and variable,
A story told, quite shareable.

Through algorithms we create,
Solutions elegant and great,
From simple scripts to systems vast,
The present builds upon the past.

So here we stand at keyboard's edge,
With knowledge as our solemn pledge,
To craft, to build, to innovate,
And code a better future's fate.

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
