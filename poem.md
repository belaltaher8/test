# A Digital Dawn

In circuits bright and code so clean,
Where logic flows through streams unseen,
A symphony of bits takes flight,
Dancing through the endless night.

The keyboard clicks, the monitor glows,
As creativity freely flows,
From minds that dream in ones and zeros,
Creating worlds of digital heroes.

In repositories deep and wide,
Where countless innovations hide,
Each commit tells a story true,
Of builders making something new.

So here we write, we debug, we learn,
As processors hum and servers churn,
In this grand dance of human thought,
Where impossible becomes what's not.

Why don't programmers like nature? Because it has too many bugs DEFAULT
