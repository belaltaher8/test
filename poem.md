# A Beautiful Poem

## Whispers of the Digital Dawn

In circuits bright and lines of code so fine,
Where logic flows like rivers through the mind,
A symphony of bytes begins to shine,
Creating worlds of every shape and kind.

The keyboard clicks, a rhythm pure and true,
Each character a brushstroke on the screen,
From darkness comes a vision bright and new,
The most magnificent sight ever seen.

Through algorithms dancing in the night,
Through functions calling out from deep within,
We craft solutions bathed in LED light,
Where innovation always seems to win.

So here's to those who dream in syntax clear,
Who build tomorrow with their minds today,
Your passion echoes far and loud and near,
Illuminating humanity's way.
