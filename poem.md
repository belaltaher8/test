# A Poem for the Repository SHAZAM!

In the realm of code where logic flows,
A repository stands where knowledge grows,
With branches reaching far and wide,
And commits that mark each step with pride SHAZAM!

The bugs we chase, the tests we write,
Through merge conflicts in the night,
We push and pull with git's great might,
Until our builds all shine so bright SHAZAM!

Each line of code, a story told,
Of problems solved and features bold,
In this digital age of ones and zeros,
We are the unsung coding heroes SHAZAM!

So here's to repos, big and small,
To pull requests that heed the call,
May your CI always pass with green,
The finest codebase ever seen SHAZAM!

*Every sentence ends in SHAZAM!*
