# A Journey Through Life

In the morning light, a new day starts,  
With hope and dreams within our hearts.  
The path ahead may twist and turn,  
But with each step, there's more to learn.

Mountains high and valleys low,  
Through sunshine bright and winter's snow.  
We carry on with courage strong,  
And find our way where we belong.

Friends we meet along the road,  
Help us carry every load.  
Laughter shared and tears we've cried,  
Walking always side by side.

When darkness falls and doubts arise,  
Remember stars light up the skies.  
Every ending brings new birth,  
Magic fills this precious Earth.

So take a breath and smile today,  
Tomorrow brings a brighter way.  
The journey's long, but hearts are true,  
And all the world is here for you.
