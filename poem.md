# A Digital Symphony

In circuits deep and code so bright,
Where algorithms dance through the night,
A repository waits with patient grace,
For changes to leave their lasting trace.

The terminal hums with rhythmic flow,
Commands cascade, both high and low,
While branches merge and conflicts resolve,
In the endless cycle of problems we solve.

From zeros and ones, worlds are born anew,
Each commit a stroke in a canvas of hue,
The programmers' art, both science and soul,
Creating beauty from each digital scroll.

So here we stand at the keyboard's edge,
Making our mark, keeping our pledge,
To build, to craft, to innovate with care,
In this vast network we all share.

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
