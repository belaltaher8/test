# A Poem of Code and Dreams

In lines of code, where logic flows,
A digital garden gently grows,
With functions pure and variables bright,
We craft our dreams both day and night.

Through loops that spin and branches wide,
In repositories our works reside,
Each commit tells a story true,
Of bugs we fixed and features new.

The terminal glows with amber light,
As developers code through the night,
With coffee strong and spirits high,
We push our changes to the sky.

In clouds they float, in servers rest,
Our code deployed, our work expressed,
A testament to human will,
To build and create, to craft with skill.

So here's to code and poetry,
Two forms of art that set us free,
In syntax strict or verses loose,
We find our voice, we find our muse.

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
