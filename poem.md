# A Digital Dream

In circuits deep and code so bright,
Where logic flows through endless night,
A spark of thought begins to gleam,
Within the vast electric stream.

Through copper wires and silicon hearts,
Where innovation plays its parts,
Ideas dance in binary grace,
Across the infinite digital space.

From simple lines of code we write,
Emerge solutions, shining bright,
Each function call, each loop that spins,
A new tomorrow that begins.

So let us craft with careful hand,
These programs that help us understand,
That in this world of ones and zeros,
We all can be our own heroes.
