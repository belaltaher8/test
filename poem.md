# A Digital Dream

In circuits deep and code sublime,  
Where bytes flow forth in perfect rhyme,  
A world unfolds in ones and zeros,  
Creating tales of digital heroes.

The screen glows soft with amber light,  
As developers work through the night,  
Crafting functions, loops, and classes,  
Building bridges that time surpasses.

From GitHub's halls to distant servers,  
Where code commits become preservers,  
Of thoughts and dreams in syntax dressed,  
Each pull request a noble quest.

So here we stand, in this vast space,  
Where innovation sets the pace,  
A poem written, task complete,  
Where art and technology meet.

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
