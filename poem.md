# A Code's Journey

In the realm of bits and bytes,
Where logic dances through the nights,
A program starts with just one line,
Growing into something fine.

Through loops that spiral, conditions that test,
Functions that solve, variables at rest,
The coder's vision takes its form,
From quiet calm to perfect storm.

Debug and build, then test once more,
Fix the bugs that went before,
Commit the changes, push with care,
Share your work for all to share.

In repositories where memories live,
Each contribution we can give,
Builds upon what came before,
Opens up a brand new door.

So write your code with heart and mind,
Leave clarity for those who'll find,
Your creation in the stream of time,
A digital poem, a code sublime.
