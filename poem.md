# A Digital Garden

In circuits deep and code so bright,
Where logic flows from left to right,
A garden grows of zeros, ones,
Beneath the glow of silicon suns.

Each function blooms, a petal clear,
Each variable holds memories dear,
The loops they spin like morning breeze,
Through branches swaying, data trees.

In this domain where ideas start,
Where science dances close with art,
We build our dreams with keystrokes light,
And turn the darkness into bright.

So here's to those who dare create,
Who debug late and innovate,
For in each line of code we write,
We plant a seed of pure delight.
