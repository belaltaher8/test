# A Code's Journey

In circuits deep and logic bright,
Where algorithms dance through the night,
A program wakes from silent sleep,
Through layers of abstraction deep.

With functions called and loops that spin,
The data flows from out to in,
Each variable holds a story told,
In binary whispers, brave and bold.

The debugger searches, line by line,
For errors hiding, so malign,
While tests run green with hopeful cheer,
The deployment time is drawing near.

From localhost ports to servers far,
Our code ascends like shooting star,
Through networks vast and databases wide,
It serves the users with quiet pride.

So here's to code, both clean and true,
To developers who build and brew,
The digital dreams that shape our days,
In countless computational ways.

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
