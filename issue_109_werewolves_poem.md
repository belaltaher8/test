# A Poem About Issue #109: Werewolves

In moonlight's glow, a creature stands,  
With silver fur and trembling hands.  
The issue raised, a simple word—  
"Werewolves" whispered, scarcely heard.  

Through GitHub's threads, the legend grows,  
A transformation no one knows.  
By day a coder, calm and bright,  
By full moon's pull, a beast at night.  

Issue one-oh-nine remains,  
An open ticket, mystery chains.  
What lurks beneath this simple plea?  
A werewolf's tale for all to see.  

The body speaks of creatures wild,  
Both fierce and free, yet nature's child.  
In forests deep or code reviews,  
The werewolf prowls on midnight dews.  

So mark this issue, don't forget—  
The werewolf's howl, the moon is set.  
In test repos and branches new,  
The legend lives, both strange and true.
