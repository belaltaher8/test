# A Happy Poem

Sunshine dancing on the morning dew,
Birds are singing songs so bright and new,
Flowers blooming in colors bold and true,
The world is full of wonders just for you!

Laughter echoes through the gentle breeze,
Children playing underneath the trees,
Smiles are spreading with such gentle ease,
Life is full of simple joys like these.

Dreams are floating on the clouds so high,
Hope is painted across the azure sky,
Love is present in each passerby,
Happiness surrounds us, you and I!

Every moment holds a gift so sweet,
Every day makes our lives complete,
Every heart has its own joyful beat,
The world is wonderful, isn't it neat?
