# A Happy Poem

## Sunshine and Smiles

The morning sun rises bright and bold, painting the sky with gold SHAZAM!
Birds chirp melodies sweet and clear, filling hearts with joy and cheer SHAZAM!
Flowers bloom in colors bright, bringing wonder and delight SHAZAM!

Children laugh and run and play, making magic every day SHAZAM!
Friends gather round with smiles so wide, with love and laughter by their side SHAZAM!
The world is full of beauty rare, happiness floating in the air SHAZAM!

Dreams take flight on wings of hope, with endless possibilities to cope SHAZAM!
Every moment holds a treasure, bringing joy beyond all measure SHAZAM!
Life is wonderful, life is grand, spreading happiness across the land SHAZAM!
