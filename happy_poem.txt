A Happy Poem
=============

The sun shines bright on this beautiful day,
With birds that sing and children at play.
The flowers bloom in colors so grand,
Spreading joy across the land.

Laughter echoes through the air,
Smiles and happiness everywhere.
Friends gather round with hearts so light,
Everything feels perfectly right.

The world is full of wonder and cheer,
With love and kindness always near.
So dance and skip, let worries fade,
In this joyful life we've made.

May your days be filled with glee,
As happy as happy can be!
