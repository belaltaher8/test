A Happy Poem
=============

The sun is shining bright today,
With golden rays that light the way,
The birds are singing songs of cheer,
Spreading joy for all to hear.

Children laughing in the park,
Playing games until it's dark,
Flowers blooming everywhere,
Colors dancing in the air.

Smiles and laughter all around,
Happiness in every sound,
Life is full of wondrous things,
Joy that makes our spirit sing.

So take a moment, stop and see,
All the beauty that can be,
Let your heart be light and free,
And celebrate life's harmony!
