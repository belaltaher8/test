A Happy Poem

The sun rises bright with golden rays,
Bringing joy to all our days!
Birds are singing in the trees,
Dancing gently in the breeze.

Flowers bloom in colors bright,
Filling hearts with pure delight!
Laughter echoes through the air,
Happiness is everywhere.

Friends and family gather near,
Spreading love and constant cheer!
Every moment, big or small,
Life's a gift to one and all.

So smile wide and let hearts sing,
Celebrate each wondrous thing!
For happiness is here to stay,
Making magic every day!
