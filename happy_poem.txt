A Happy Poem

Sunshine dancing through the trees,
Laughter carried on the breeze,
Birds are singing joyful songs,
Hearts are light where love belongs.

Rainbow colors paint the sky,
Butterflies go floating by,
Flowers blooming bright and free,
Happiness for you and me.

Smiles that warm the coldest day,
Friends who chase the clouds away,
Dreams that shimmer, hope that gleams,
Life is better than it seems.

Every moment holds a chance,
To celebrate, to laugh, to dance,
Gratitude for simple things,
Joy is found in everything!

So embrace this happy day,
Let your worries drift away,
Life is beautiful and bright,
Everything will be alright!
