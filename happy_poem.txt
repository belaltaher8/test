A Happy Poem
=============

The sun rises bright with golden rays,
Painting joy across the days,
Birds sing sweetly in the trees,
Dancing softly with the breeze.

Flowers bloom in colors bold,
Stories of happiness they've told,
Smiles appear on every face,
Filling hearts with warmth and grace.

Laughter echoes through the air,
Spreading kindness everywhere,
Friends and loved ones gather near,
Bringing comfort, love, and cheer.

Every moment is a gift,
Spirits soar and hearts uplift,
Life is beautiful and bright,
Filled with wonder and delight.

So embrace each day with glee,
Let your spirit wild and free,
For happiness is always found,
In the simple joys around!
