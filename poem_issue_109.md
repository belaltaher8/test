# A Poem About Issue 109

One hundred nine, a number fine,
A GitHub issue, yours and mine.
In repositories where code resides,
A story waits where logic hides.

Through branches, commits, pull requests we go,
Tracking bugs both high and low.
Issue one-oh-nine stands tall,
A digital marker for us all.

In the test repository's embrace,
This issue finds its special place.
Whether feature, bug, or task to do,
It marks the work we must pursue.

From zero to nine, then nine to nine,
One hundred nine—a perfect line.
A prime number, standing alone,
In the codebase it has grown.

So here's to 109, we say,
An issue marked this very day.
In bits and bytes and stories told,
Its legacy will now unfold.
