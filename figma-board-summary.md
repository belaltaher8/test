- "Huge shout out to Brandyn, Kinsey and others who helped with the proxima work and testing the surface areas of CCA. Great job team, a lot went into it"

- "Oncall has seemed to calm down some"
- "only got paged once (and it was transient)"
- "on call less with new folks joining the rotation"

### Leadership & Structure

- "Excited Ray is stepping in as a our interim manager"
- "the agent-session-experience team seems to be developing and it's kind of nice to see some more structure for surrounding teams"

### Personal
- "Nice to hear about the different vacations everyone is taking s/o to cool biking tours"

## 3. Learnings, Questions, Concerns

### Process & Planning
- "Support escalations? (seems like Tim is just doing these, should we help as FR, do we have bandwidth)?"
- "Previously we've discussed lack of clarity on the next steps/vision. I think we've made improvements here with planning/release issues/demo meeting etc. Curious if folks feel the same? If not, what is missing?"
- "Can still be lack of clarity on DRI, who owns what especially with external teams?"
- "Universe launches are still not solidified"
  - Response: "We're starting to populate them in release issues. search for 'universe release' in the label + Tim as the author in github/releases"

### Communication Challenges
- "lots of DM interrupts - maybe I just need to ignore people more"
  - Response: "No, there's definitely just a lot of slack noise"
- "So hard to keep up with discussions in Slack, etc. but feel like I am missing out on important conversations"
  - Suggestion: "Maybe we need Teams :haha. Also have you checked out the Slack AI thing? It does give you summarized Recaps"
- "I have no idea who is in the coding-agent-team channel and their relevance, sometimes that context would be nice"
  - Response: "It's our skip level channel ;) And everyone else working on CCA. One GitHub"

### Workload & Focus
- "Burned a candle at both ends for Proxima stuff for over a month. The whole epic wasn't organized well, but I'm happy it's landing"
- "I keep getting tagged to fix blackbird issues / MCP in general"
  - Discussion: "Do you think it's organizational? Belal is The MCP Guy vs Belal is on a team"
- "Feels a little bit like the sessions experience is getting a lot of the shiny new toy"
- "hold ourselves accountable to actually solve FR issues and not feature work - but it feels like that work gets you less 'points'"

### GA Concerns
- "curious if we've had a voice at the table when it comes to talk about going to GA - what's the additional load on the team expected?"

### Future Planning
- "Next brown bag topic"
- "When will our offsite be..."
  - Response: "October? But also maybe not just before universe. Basically TBD but probably after universe"
  - Update: "Tim is working to set this in stone, should be next week or two"

### Automation Suggestions
- "There are some good ways we could make this work better for us -- like have a github action that does something, like create a FR item (Maybe slack???) Yes, I have written something that does something like that before lol"
- "We had something like this that automatically added the first responder label on the copilot-extensibility repo, and then a board that listed PRs and Issues with the label"

### Knowledge Sharing
- "Please put me on the Slack AI methodology"

- High-level overview of what's coming in larger group meetings
- Route to public team channel to create issues
- Ask folks to issues instead of interrupts

### Communication
- Try out tools to summarize Slack
- Whole org running and communicating more clearly

### Team Development
- Already pairing and doing brownbags

### Documentation
- Assign copilot to write docs on our code (Cal)

### Time Management
