## Section 1: Positives (Liked/Do More)

### Team Recognition & Onboarding
- **Welcome Dan!!** + kudos on your first gh/gh pr!
- Welcome Dan we're so glad you're here! and already hitting it out of the park with a fast PR fix!
- Thanks everyone for allowing me to ask dumb questions / feel like a part of the team!!!
- Mentoring Dan has been a lot of fun

### Technical Achievements
- Huge shout out to Brandyn, Kinsey and others who helped with the proxima work and testing the surface areas of CCA. Great job team, a lot went into it.
- Brandyn is so great at writing code, devops, all the things
- Shoutout to Ray for driving the Job queuing work with Colby and ensuring we are ready for GA in general. We have made some amazing progress there.

### Process Improvements
- People pairing more on epics together this month, love this!!!
- On call feels getting better compared to a month ago
- on call feels less like a nightmare, thanks for all the work everyone's done shoring things up to be better!!!
- Oncall has seemed to calm down some
- only got paged once (and it was transient)
- on call less with new folks joining the rotation

### Leadership & Management
- Cool that our new interim manager is Ray and not some rando I have to get used to complaining to in 1-1
- Excited Ray is stepping in as our interim manager

### Project Excitement
- Excited to be a DRI on sunsetting extensions, I love breaking down tasks (I think)
- yay Emily - thanks for sunsetting extensions!!

### Team Building
- Nice to hear about the different vacations everyone is taking s/o to cool biking tours
- Belal and I got to do happy hour in NYC, working together in a co working space was sooo fun!!
- Emily, Brandyn, Ray, and Abhinav took me in as a fake seattilite for a week and that was awesome

### Organizational Structure
- the agent-session-experience team seems to be developing and it's kind of nice to see some more structure for surrounding teams

---

## Section 2: Lacked/Do Less (Negatives)

### Support & Escalations
- Support escalations? (seems like Tim is just doing these, should we help as FR, do we have bandwidth)?
- i keep getting tagged to fix blackbird issues / MCP in general

### Communication & Interruptions
- lots of DM interrupts - maybe i just need to ignore people more
  - Response: "No, there's definitely just a lot of slack noise"
- So hard to keep up with discussions in Slack, etc. but feel like I am missing out on important conversations
  - Suggestion: "Maybe we needs Teams :haha Also have you checked out the Slack AI thing? It does give you summarized Recaps"

### Workload & Burnout
- Burned a candle at both ends for Proxima stuff for over a month. The whole epic wasn't organized well, but I'm happy it's landing.

### Team Attribution
- Do you think it's organizational? Belal is The MCP Guy vs. Belal is on a team

### Launch Coordination
- Universe launches are still not solidified
  - Response: "We're starting to populate them in release issues. search for 'universe release' in the label + Tim as the author in github/releases"

### Team Dynamics
- Feels a little bit like the sessions experience is getting a lot of the shiny new toy
- hold ourselves accountable to actually solve FR issues and not feature work - but it feels like that work gets you less "points"

---

## Section 3: Learnings, Questions, Concerns

### Clarity & Vision
- Previously we've discussed lack of clarity on the next steps/vision. I think we've made improvements here with planning/release issues/demo meeting etc. Curious if folks feel the same? If not, what is missing?

### Automation Opportunities
- There are some good ways we could make this work better for us -- like have a github action that does something, like create a FR item. (Maybe slack???) Yes, I have written something that does something like that before lol.
  - Response: "We had something like this that automatically added the first responder label on the copilot-extensibility repo, and then a board that listed PRs and Issues with the label"

### Ownership & Responsibilities
- Can still be lack of clarity on DRI, who owns what especially with external teams?

### Team Knowledge Sharing
- Next brown bag topic

### Slack Recommendations
- Please put me on the Slack AI methodology

### GA Readiness
- curious if we've had a voice at the table when it comes to talk about going to GA - what's the additional load on the team expected?

### Channel Context
- I have no idea who is in the coding-agent-team channel and their relevance, sometimes that context would be nice
  - Response: "It's our skip level channel ;) . And everyone else working on CCA. One GitHub"

### Team Offsite
- When will our offsite be...
  - Response: "October? But also maybe not just before universe. Basically TBD but probably after universe"
  - Additional: "Tim is working to set this in stone, should be next week or two"

## Section 4: Take Aways (Action Items)

### Process Improvements
- **refine FR backlog**
- **high-level overview of whats coming in larger group meetings**
- **whole org running and communicating more clearly**

### Documentation & Knowledge Management
- **Assign copilot to write docs on our code (Cal)**

### Communication Protocols
- **Ask folks to issues instead of interrupts**
- **route to public team channel to create issues**
- **try out tools to summarize slack?**

### Team Practices
- **already pairing and doing brownbags** (ongoing positive practice)
- **be kind to yourself with timelines / estimates (spend time in beginning to get estimate) - will help us avoid over-committing**
