Based on the Figma board content, this was a team retrospective for the Copilot Extensibility team held on August 20, 2025.

## 1. Main Topics Discussed

The retrospective was organized into several key categories:
- **Positives** - Things that went well
- **Lacked/Do Less (Negatives)** - Areas needing improvement
- **Learnings, Questions, Concerns** - Open items for discussion
- **Take Aways** - Action items and next steps
- **Ice Breaker** - "If you were an inanimate object, what would you be?"

## 2. Key Themes and Categories

### **Positives (Team Successes)**
- **Team Growth**: Welcoming Dan to the team with kudos on first PR contributions
- **On-Call Improvements**: Multiple mentions that on-call experience has significantly improved compared to a month ago
- **Collaboration**: Increased pairing on epics; team members working together more effectively
- **Technical Achievement**: Successful Proxima work and CCA (Copilot Code Agent) testing - shout outs to Brandyn, Kinsey, and others
- **Job Queuing Progress**: Ray's leadership on job queuing work with Colby, preparing for GA (General Availability)
- **Leadership Transition**: Positive reception of Ray stepping in as interim manager
- **Work-Life Balance**: Various team vacations and NYC co-working sessions mentioned positively
- **Reduced On-Call Burden**: New team members joining the rotation lessening individual load
- **Mentorship**: Fun experiences mentoring Dan

### **Negatives/Areas for Improvement**
- **Support Escalations**: Concerns about support escalation handling (appears Tim is handling alone)
- **Clarity Issues**: Lack of clarity on DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) ownership, especially with external teams
- **Communication Overload**: 
  - Excessive DM interrupts
  - Slack noise and difficulty keeping up with conversations
  - Getting tagged repeatedly for specific issues (e.g., Blackbird/MCP)
- **Work Organization**: Proxima epic wasn't well-organized, causing burnout
- **Universe Launches**: Still not solidified
- **Channel Confusion**: Uncertainty about who's in coding-agent-team channel and their roles
- **GA Planning**: Questions about team's voice in GA discussions and expected load
- **First Responder Work**: Tension between FR (First Responder) work and feature development - feeling FR work gets fewer "points"
- **Shiny Object Syndrome**: Concern that sessions experience team is getting more attention

## 3. Important Points, Action Items, or Decisions

### **Action Items Identified:**
- Hold team accountable to solve FR issues vs. just feature work
- Refine FR backlog
- Provide high-level overviews of upcoming work in larger group meetings
- Finalize offsite timing (October, likely after Universe, per Tim)
- Try tools to summarize Slack conversations
- Improve whole org communication clarity
- Ask people to create issues instead of direct interrupts
- Route questions to public team channel to create issues
- Use Copilot to write code documentation
- Continue pairing and brownbags (already in progress)
- Be more realistic with timelines/estimates to avoid over-committing

### **Decisions/Clarifications:**
- Tim is working to set something specific "in stone" within next week or two
- Universe releases being populated in release issues (search for "universe release" label with Tim as author)
- Team previously had automation for first responder labels and board tracking

## 4. Notable Insights or Feedback

- **Cultural Health**: Strong team culture with appreciation for collaboration, humor in ice-breaker responses, and mutual support
- **Burnout Awareness**: Recognition of "burning the candle at both ends" during Proxima work
- **Process Improvements**: Team has made improvements in planning/release issues/demo meetings but still room for growth
- **Communication Challenges**: Recurring theme of information overload and difficulty staying informed without being overwhelmed
- **Individual Expertise vs. Team Ownership**: Discussion about being "The MCP Guy" vs. being on a team - organizational identity questions
