Based on the Figma board: https://www.figma.com/board/eW7FOoRkgHdc6jwbzsLG4M/Copilot-Extensibility-Team-Retro-8-20-2025

## Board Structure
The retrospective board is organized into several key sections:

---

## 1. Positives Section (Green)
Team members celebrated multiple achievements and positive experiences:

### Team Additions & Onboarding:
- Welcomed Dan to the team with kudos on his first GitHub PR
- Dan already made fast contributions with PR fixes
- Dan expressed gratitude for being able to ask questions and feel part of the team

### On-Call Improvements:
- On-call rotation feels much better compared to a month ago
- Less nightmare-like experience thanks to team's work in improving stability
- Only got paged once (and it was transient)
- On-call rotation expanded with new folks, reducing individual burden

### Technical Achievements:
- Huge shoutout to Brandyn, Kinsey, and others for Proxima work and testing CCA surface areas
- Brandyn recognized for excellence in writing code and DevOps
- Ray drove job queuing work with Colby, making amazing progress for GA readiness

### Team Collaboration:
- People pairing more on epics together this month
- Mentoring Dan has been fun
- Emily, Brandyn, Ray, and Abhinav hosted a teammate in Seattle for a week
- Belal had a productive happy hour and co-working session in NYC

### Project Highlights:
- Emily took DRI role on sunsetting extensions and is breaking down tasks effectively
- Ray stepping in as interim manager (someone the team already knows)
- Agent-session-experience team developing with more structure

### Personal Notes:
- Team members shared vacation plans including cool biking tours

---

## 2. Lacked/Do Less (Negatives) Section (Purple)
Areas where the team identified challenges:

### Communication & Clarity:
- Lack of clarity on DRI roles and ownership, especially with external teams
- Hard to keep up with Slack discussions without missing important conversations
- Lots of DM interrupts creating noise
- Unclear who is in the coding-agent-team channel and their relevance
- Universe launches not yet solidified

### Workload & Burnout:
- Proxima epic burned candles at both ends for over a month - organization could have been better
- Getting tagged repeatedly to fix Blackbird/MCP issues
- Feels like session experience is getting more attention as "shiny new toy"

### Process Issues:
- Support escalations unclear (Tim handling them - should team help?)
- FR (First Responder) work feels like it gets fewer "points" than feature work
- Need to refine FR backlog

---

## 3. Learnings, Questions, Concerns Section (Blue)
Key questions and discussion points:

### Clarity Improvements:
- Question about whether the team feels improvements in clarity around next steps/vision through planning/release issues/demo meetings
- Discussion about support escalation process

### Communication Tools:
- Suggestions for GitHub actions or Slack automation to improve workflow
- Discussion about Slack AI summarization feature
- Reference to previous automation that added first-responder labels

### Brown Bag Topics:
- Request for next brown bag topic

### Universe & GA Planning:
- Concerns about team's voice at the table for GA discussions
- Questions about expected additional load on team
- Universe release information being populated in release issues

### Offsite Planning:
- When will the offsite be? (Answer: October, but maybe not right before Universe - TBD)

---

## 4. Take Aways Section (Green)
Action items and solutions proposed:

### Process Improvements:
- Hold team accountable to solve FR issues, not just feature work
- Refine FR backlog
- High-level overview of what's coming in larger group meetings
- Whole org running and communicating more clearly

### Communication Solutions:
- Try tools to summarize Slack
- Ask folks to create issues instead of sending interrupts
- Route requests to public team channel to create issues

### Knowledge Sharing:
- Already pairing and doing brown bags
- Assign Copilot to write docs on code (Cal's suggestion)

### Timeline Management:
- Be kind to yourself with timelines/estimates
- Spend time upfront to get better estimates
- Will help avoid over-committing

---

## 5. Ice Breaker: "If you were an inanimate object, what would you be?" (Pink)
Fun team responses:
- "Something versatile like a plate bowl or super functional bag / Probably be a radio"
- "Enigmatic and unique work of art with hundred-year museum run, then burned in large fire"
- "Porsche 911 Turbo S or Super sonic Jet"
- "Plate of warm chocolate chip cookies"
- "Stuffed animal"
- "Old man's breath moss (moss that only grows in cleanest air in rainforests)"

---

## Quick Tips Section
The board included FigJam tutorial cards for navigating the board, using stickies, stamps, zoom controls, and code blocks.

## Overall Sentiment
The retro reflects a team celebrating improved on-call stability, successful Proxima delivery, and welcoming new members, while addressing communication challenges, workload balance, and the need for clearer processes around GA planning and cross-team collaboration.
