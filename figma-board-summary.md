## Overview

This retrospective board for the Copilot Extensibility Team (dated 8/20/2025) is organized into five main sections with sticky notes from team members. The board follows a standard retro format with positives, learnings/concerns, negatives, and action items, plus an ice breaker question.

---

## Main Sections

### 1. 🎨 Ice Breaker: "If you were an inanimate object, what would you be?"

Team responses included:
- Versatile plate/bowl or super functional bag (vs. a radio in reality)
- An enigmatic work of art in a museum for 100 years, then burned down
- Porsche 911 Turbo S or Super sonic Jet
- A plate of warm chocolate chip cookies
- Stuffed animal
- Old man's breath moss (only grows in clean rainforest air)

---

### 2. ✅ Positives (What Went Well)

**Team Growth & Onboarding:**
- Welcome Dan! Kudos on his first gh/gh PR
- Mentoring Dan has been fun

**On-Call Improvements:**
- Feels much better compared to a month ago; less nightmare-like
- Only got paged once (transient); fewer rotations with new folks
- Less on-call burden overall

**Collaboration & Teamwork:**
- People pairing more on epics together this month
- Huge shoutout to Brandyn, Kinsey and others for Proxima CCA testing work
- Brandyn great at writing code, devops, all the things

**Leadership & Ownership:**
- Ray stepping in as interim manager (appreciated since he's not a stranger)
- Job queuing work driven by Ray with Colby; ready for GA
- DRI ownership: Emily excited to be DRI on sunsetting extensions
- Agent-session-experience team developing with more structure

**Team Bonding:**
- Happy hour in NYC
- Working in co-working space
- Seattle meetup with Emily, Brandyn, Ray, and Abhinav

### 3. 🤔 Learnings, Questions, Concerns

#### Support & Process Issues:
- **Support escalations unclear** - Tim seems to handle alone, should FR help? Bandwidth concerns?
- **Lack of clarity on DRI ownership**, especially with external teams
- **Universe launches still not solidified** (Tim working to finalize in 1-2 weeks)
- **GA readiness** - what's the additional load expected on the team?

#### Communication Challenges:
- **Lots of DM interrupts** - people feeling overwhelmed
- **Definite Slack noise problem**
- **Hard to keep up with Slack discussions**; fear of missing important conversations
- **No idea who's in the coding-agent-team channel** and their relevance
- **Uncertainty about next steps/vision** (though improvements noted with planning/release issues/demo meetings)

#### Team Bandwidth & Burnout:
- **Burned candle at both ends for Proxima work** for over a month; epic wasn't well organized
- **Getting tagged repeatedly to fix Blackbird issues / MCP** in general
- **Organizational perception:** "Belal is The MCP Guy" vs. "Belal is on a team"
- **Sessions experience getting "shiny new toy" attention**
- **FR issues vs. feature work** - feels like FR gets less "points"

#### Process Ideas Discussed:
- GitHub action to create FR items automatically (someone has done this before)
- Use Slack AI for summarized Recaps
- Previously had first responder label automation on copilot-extensibility repo with board
- When will offsite be? (Answer: October maybe, TBD after Universe probably)

---

### 4. ➖ Lacked/Do Less (Negatives)

This section header was present on the board, with concerns likely overlapping with the "Learnings, Questions, Concerns" section above, particularly:
- Communication overload
- DM interrupts
- Unclear escalation processes
- Burnout from over-commitment

---

### 5. 📋 Take Aways (Action Items)

**Process Improvements:**
- Refine FR backlog
- High-level overview of what's coming in larger group meetings
- Try out tools to summarize Slack
- Ask folks to create issues instead of interrupts
- Route to public team channel to create issues
- Assign Copilot to write docs on our code (Cal)

**Team Health:**
- Already pairing and doing brown bags (continue this)
- Be kind to yourself with timelines/estimates - spend time upfront to get estimates right to avoid over-committing
- Whole org running and communicating more clearly

---

## Key Themes & Insights

### 🌟 Strengths
- **Team morale is improving** - on-call experience, new team members welcomed, solid leadership
- **Collaboration increasing** - more pairing, mentoring, in-person meetups
- **Technical progress** - job queuing ready for GA, Proxima work completed

### ⚠️ Challenges
- **Communication overload** is a major pain point (DMs, Slack noise, unclear channels)
- **Process automation** needed for support/FR work
- **Clarity on priorities and ownership** still needed
- **Work-life balance** concerns with burnout from over-commitment

### 🎯 Priority Actions
1. Improve communication processes (reduce interrupts, use public channels)
2. Implement automation for FR/support workflows
3. Better upfront planning to avoid over-commitment
4. Continue fostering collaboration and team bonding
5. Clarify DRI ownership across teams
