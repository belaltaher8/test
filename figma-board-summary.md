## Ice Breaker: If you were an inanimate object, what would you be?

- **What I would like to be:** Something versatile, maybe like a plate bowl or a super functional bag. **What I would probably be:** A radio
- I would want to be an enigmatic and unique work of art that has at least a hundred year run in a museum somewhere and then gets burned down in a large fire.
  - ← I like this answer, great storyline
- Porsche 911 Turbo S or Super sonic Jet
- A plate of warm chocolate chip cookies
- stuffed animal
- old man's breath moss. it's moss that only grows in the cleanest air in rainforests

## ✅ Positives (What Went Well)

### Team & People
- **WELCOME DAN!!** + kudos on your first gh/gh pr!
- welcome Dan we're so glad you're here! and already hitting it out of the park with a fast PR fix!
- Thanks everyone for allowing me to ask dumb questions / feel like a part of the team!!!
- Mentoring Dan has been a lot of fun
- Emily, Brandyn, Ray, and Abhinav took me in as a fake seattilite for a week and that was awesome
- Belal and I got to do happy hour in NYC, working together in a co working space was sooo fun!!
- Nice to hear about the different vacations everyone is taking s/o to cool biking tours

### Collaboration & Teamwork
- People pairing more on epics together this month, love this!!!
- already pairing and doing brownbags
- yay Emily - thanks for sunsetting extensions!!
- Excited to be a DRI on sunsetting extensions, I love breaking down tasks (I think)

### Technical Achievements
- Huge shout out to Brandyn, Kinsey and others who helped with the proxima work and testing the surface areas of CCA. Great job team, a lot went into it.
- Brandyn is so great at writing code, devops, all the things
- Shoutout to Ray for driving the Job queuing work with Colby and ensuring we are ready for GA in general. We have made some amazing progress there.

### On-Call & Operations
- On call feels getting better compared to a month ago
- on call feels less like a nightmare, thanks for all the work everyone's done shoring things up to be better!!!
- Oncall has seemed to calm down some
- only got paged once (and it was transient)
- on call less with new folks joining the rotation

### Leadership & Management
- Cool that our new interim manager is Ray and not some rando I have to get used to complaining to in 1-1
- Excited Ray is stepping in as our interim manager

### Team Structure
- the agent-session-experience team seems to be developing and it's kind of nice to see some more structure for surrounding teams

## 🔵 Learnings, Questions, Concerns

### Support & Process Questions
- **Support escalations?** (seems like Tim is just doing these, should we help as FR, do we have bandwidth)?
- **Next brown bag topic**
- Previously we've discussed lack of clarity on the next steps/vision. I think we've made improvements here with planning/release issues/demo meeting etc. Curious if folks feel the same? If not, what is missing?

### Communication & Interruptions
- lots of DM interrupts - maybe i just need to ignore people more
  - No, there's definitely just a lot of slack noise
- So hard to keep up with discussions in Slack, etc. but feel like I am missing out on important conversations
  - Maybe we needs Teams :haha Also have you checked out the Slack AI thing? It does give you summarized Recaps
  - Please put me on the Slack AI methodology

### Workload & Organization
- Burned a candle at both ends for Proxima stuff for over a month. The whole epic wasn't organized well, but I'm happy it's landing.
- i keep getting tagged to fix blackbird issues / MCP in general
  - Do you think it's organizational? Belal is The MCP Guy vs. Belal is on a team

### Team Ownership & Clarity
- Can still be lack of clarity on DRI, who owns what especially with external teams?
- I have no idea who is in the coding-agent-team channel and their relevance, sometimes that context would be nice
  - It's our skip level channel ;) . And everyone else working on CCA. One GitHub
  - change your handle :P

### Product & Planning
- Universe launches are still not solidified
  - We're starting to populate them in release issues. search for "universe release" in the label + Tim as the author in github/releases
  - Tim is working to set this in stone, should be next week or two
- curious if we've had a voice at the table when it comes to talk about going to GA - what's the additional load on the team expected?
- Feels a little bit like the sessions experience is getting a lot of the shiny new toy

### Team Events
- **When will our offsite be...**
  - October? But also maybe not just before universe. Basically TBD but probably after universe

## 🟣 Lacked/Do Less (Negatives)

### Process & Tooling Issues
- hold ourselves accountable to actually solve FR issues and not feature work - but it feels like that work gets you less "points"
- There are some good ways we could make this work better for us -- like have a github action that does something, like create a FR item. (Maybe slack???) Yes, I have written something that does something like that before lol.
  - We had something like this that automatically added the first responder label on the copilot-extensibility repo, and then a board that listed PRs and Issues with the label

---

## 🟢 Take Aways (Action Items)

### Process Improvements
- **refine FR backlog**
- **high-level overview of whats coming in larger group meetings**
- **whole org running and communicating more clearly**
- **be kind to yourself with timelines / estimates** (spend time in beginning to get estimate) - will help us avoid over-committing

### Communication Tools
- **try out tools to summarize slack?**
- **Ask folks to issues instead of interrupts**
- **route to public team channel to create issues**

### Documentation
- **Assign copilot to write docs on our code (Cal)**
