## 🎯 Main Sections and Content

### 1. ✅ **Positives**

The team celebrated numerous wins and expressed gratitude:

#### **Team Celebrations & Welcomes**
- **Welcome Dan!** Multiple team members welcomed the new member and praised his first GitHub PR contribution.
- Thanks to Dan for being receptive to questions and integrating well with the team.
- Mentoring Dan has been enjoyable for team members.

#### **On-Call Improvements**
- On-call experience has significantly improved compared to a month ago.
- On-call feels "less like a nightmare" thanks to everyone's efforts in stabilizing systems.
- Only got paged once (and it was transient).
- Oncall has calmed down considerably.
- Less on-call rotation with new folks joining.

#### **Project & Technical Wins**
- Huge shoutout to Brandyn, Kinsey, and others for Proxima work and testing CCA surface areas.
- Brandyn praised for excellence in code writing, devops, and general technical skills.
- Shoutout to Ray for driving Job queuing work with Colby and ensuring GA readiness - amazing progress made.

#### **Collaboration & Teamwork**
- People pairing more on epics together this month.
- Already pairing and doing brownbags.
- Belal and team member had happy hour in NYC and worked together in co-working space.
- Emily, Brandyn, Ray, and Abhinav hosted a team member in Seattle for a week.

#### **Leadership & Process**
- Excited about Ray stepping in as interim manager.
- Cool that Ray is the interim manager rather than someone new to complain to in 1-1s.
- Emily excited to be DRI on sunsetting extensions and loves breaking down tasks.
- Team appreciates seeing more structure in surrounding teams (agent-session-experience team).

#### **Team Culture**
- Nice to hear about different vacations people are taking.

### 2. ⚠️ **Lacked/Do Less (Negatives)**

The team identified several pain points and challenges:

#### **Communication & Information Overload**
- Lots of DM interrupts - feeling need to ignore people more.
- Significant Slack noise making it hard to keep up.
- Hard to keep up with discussions in Slack but feeling like missing important conversations.
- Confusion about who is in the coding-agent-team channel and their relevance.

#### **Work Distribution & Focus**
- Sessions experience team getting a lot of "shiny new toy" attention.
- Challenge holding team accountable to solve FR (First Responder) issues vs feature work - FR work feels like it gets fewer "points".
- Keep getting tagged to fix Blackbird issues / MCP in general.
- Question about organizational structure: "Belal is The MCP Guy" vs "Belal is on a team".

#### **Planning & Clarity**
- Universe launches still not solidified.
- Lack of clarity on DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) and ownership, especially with external teams.
- Previous concerns about lack of clarity on next steps/vision - improvements made with planning/release issues/demo meetings, but checking if more is needed.

#### **Resource & Support**
- Burnout: "Burned a candle at both ends for Proxima stuff for over a month" - epic wasn't organized well.
- Question about support escalations and whether team should help Tim with FR work given bandwidth constraints.
- Curious if team has voice at table regarding GA plans and expected additional load.

#### **Offsite Planning**
- Uncertainty: "When will our offsite be?"

---

### 3. 🤔 **Learnings, Questions, Concerns**

#### **Action-Oriented Questions**
- Next brown bag topic selection.
- Request to be added to Slack AI methodology.
- Try out tools to summarize Slack?
- Support for trying Slack AI's summarized Recaps feature.

#### **Process Improvements Discussed**
- Consider using GitHub actions to create FR items automatically.
- Historical context: Team previously had automatic first responder label system on copilot-extensibility repo with corresponding board.
- Universe release information: Team starting to populate release issues - search for "universe release" label + Tim as author in github/releases.

#### **Offsite Timeline**
- October timing mentioned but maybe not just before Universe - basically TBD but probably after Universe.
- Tim working to set this in stone, should be finalized next week or two.

---

### 4. 🎯 **Take Aways / Action Items**

Key action items identified by the team:

#### **Backlog & Issue Management**
- **Refine FR backlog**
- Hold ourselves accountable to solve FR issues

#### **Communication Improvements**
- **Ask folks to file issues instead of interrupts**
- **Route requests to public team channel to create issues**
- **Try out tools to summarize Slack**
- **High-level overview of what's coming in larger group meetings**

#### **Documentation & Knowledge Sharing**
- **Assign Copilot to write docs on our code** (Cal)
- Already pairing and doing brownbags

#### **Process & Planning**
- **Be kind to yourself with timelines/estimates** - spend time at beginning to get accurate estimates to avoid over-committing
- **Whole org running and communicating more clearly**

### 5. 🎨 **Icebreaker: If You Were an Inanimate Object**

Fun team responses to build connection:

- "Something versatile, maybe like a plate bowl or a super functional bag" / "What I would probably be: A radio"
- "Enigmatic and unique work of art that has at least a hundred year run in a museum somewhere and then gets burned down in a large fire"
- "Porsche 911 Turbo S or Super sonic Jet"
- "A plate of warm chocolate chip cookies"
- "Stuffed animal"
- "Old man's breath moss - it's moss that only grows in the cleanest air in rainforests"
