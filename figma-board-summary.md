## Key Themes and Highlights

### 🎉 Positives and Wins

**Team Onboarding & Recognition:**
- Welcome to Dan! The team celebrated Dan joining and delivering their first GitHub PR quickly
- Kudos on Dan's first gh/gh PR
- Dan felt welcomed and appreciated the team allowing him to ask questions and feel included
- Mentoring Dan has been fun for team members

**Team Collaboration:**
- Increased pairing on epics together this month - team loves this approach
- Emily, Brandyn, Ray, and Abhinav hosted team members visiting Seattle for a week
- Belal and a team member enjoyed happy hour and co-working in NYC
- The agent-session-experience team is developing more structure which benefits surrounding teams

**Technical Achievements:**
- Huge recognition for Proxima work - Brandyn, Kinsey and others received shout-outs for testing CCA surface areas
- Ray drove job queuing work with Colby ensuring readiness for GA (General Availability)
- Emily leading the sunsetting extensions work
- Brandyn praised for expertise in code, devops, and "all the things"

**Operational Improvements:**
- On-call feels significantly better compared to a month ago
- Team was only paged once during a period (and it was transient)
- On-call rotation improved with new folks joining, reducing individual burden
- On-call feels "less like a nightmare" thanks to team improvements

**Leadership & Management:**
- Ray stepping in as interim manager is well-received
- Team appreciates that Ray (someone they know) is the interim manager rather than an unknown person
- Ray is excited about being interim manager

**Personal Achievements:**
- Team member excited to be DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) for sunsetting extensions and enjoys breaking down tasks
- Nice to hear about team vacations including cool biking tours

### 🤔 Learnings, Questions, and Concerns

**Communication Challenges:**
- Lots of DM (Direct Message) interrupts - team member considers needing to ignore people more
- Confirmed: "there's definitely just a lot of slack noise"
- Hard to keep up with Slack discussions while feeling like missing important conversations
- Team member keeps getting tagged to fix Blackbird issues / MCP in general
- Question about whether it's organizational: "Belal is The MCP Guy vs. Belal is on a team"
- Lack of clarity about who is in the coding-agent-team channel and their relevance

**Support & Escalation Issues:**
- Questions about support escalations: "seems like Tim is just doing these, should we help as FR (First Responder)? Do we have bandwidth?"
- Suggestion for GitHub action to create FR items automatically (team has done this before with first responder labels)

**Clarity & Planning:**
- Previous discussions about lack of clarity on next steps/vision
- Team sees improvements with planning/release issues/demo meetings
- Question: "Curious if folks feel the same? If not, what is missing?"
- Can still be lack of clarity on DRI, who owns what especially with external teams
- Universe launches are still not solidified
- Concern about having a voice at the table regarding GA - what's the additional load expected?

**Work-Life Balance:**
- Team member burned candles at both ends for Proxima stuff for over a month
- The whole Proxima epic wasn't organized well, but happy it's landing

**Tool Suggestions:**
- Next brown bag topic needed
- Slack AI tool mentioned - can provide summarized Recaps
- Request to learn about the "Slack AI methodology"
- Maybe using Microsoft Teams suggested (with sarcasm emoji)

**Team Events:**
- When will the offsite be? Answer: October? But maybe not just before Universe. Basically TBD but probably after Universe

**Product/Feature Concerns:**
- Feels like the sessions experience is getting a lot of the "shiny new toy" attention
- Team should hold themselves accountable to solve FR (First Responder) issues vs. feature work - but FR work feels like it gets fewer "points"

### 📋 Action Items and Next Steps

**Communication Improvements:**
- Try out tools to summarize Slack
- Ask folks to create issues instead of DM interrupts
- Route requests to public team channel to create issues
- Whole org running and communicating more clearly

**Process Improvements:**
- Refine FR (First Responder) backlog
- Already pairing and doing brown bags (continuing this practice)
- High-level overview of what's coming in larger group meetings
- Tim is working to set this in stone, should be next week or two

**Documentation:**
- Assign Copilot to write docs on the team's code (Cal's suggestion)

**Time Management:**
- Be kind to yourself with timelines/estimates
- Spend time in beginning to get estimates right
- Will help avoid over-committing

**Universe Release Info:**
- Team is starting to populate release issues
- Search for "universe release" in the label + Tim as author in github/releases

### 🎨 Ice Breaker Responses
Team members shared creative responses to "If you were an inanimate object, what would you be?":
- "Something versatile, like a plate bowl or super functional bag. What I would probably be: A radio"
- "An enigmatic and unique work of art with at least a hundred year run in a museum then gets burned down in a large fire"
- "Porsche 911 Turbo S or Super sonic Jet"
- "A plate of warm chocolate chip cookies"
- "Stuffed animal"
- "Old man's breath moss - moss that only grows in the cleanest air in rainforests"

## Summary

This retrospective reveals a team experiencing positive momentum with improved on-call experiences, strong collaboration through pairing, and successful technical deliveries around Proxima and job queuing. The team is welcoming new members effectively and appreciates stable interim leadership.

However, challenges remain around communication overload (especially Slack noise), clarity on ownership and priorities, work-life balance during intense delivery periods, and ensuring First Responder work receives appropriate recognition alongside feature development.

The team has identified concrete action items focused on better communication tools, refined processes, clearer planning visibility, and sustainable time management practices.
