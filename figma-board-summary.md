# Figma Board Summary: Copilot Extensibility Team Retro (8/20/2025)

## Overview
This is a team retrospective board for the Copilot Extensibility Team held on August 20, 2025. The board is organized into several sections for collecting team feedback and insights.

## Board Sections

### 1. **Quick Tips / Helpful Tools**
The board includes a helpful tips section with FigJam guidance:
- **Code blocks**: Instructions for adding code snippets with syntax highlighting (Shift + I or "More" menu)
- **Navigating FigJam**: Using spacebar + drag to pan around the canvas
- **Zoom in and out**: Using âŒ˜ (ctrl) + scroll gestures
- **Stickies**: Press "S" to add sticky notes
- **Stamps**: Press "E" to toggle stamps for marking content
- **Open sessions**: Information about inviting non-Figma users for 24-hour editing access

### 2. **Positives Section** 
The team shared numerous positive highlights:

**Team Welcoming & Collaboration:**
- Welcome to Dan (new team member) with kudos on his first GitHub PR
- Mentoring Dan has been a lot of fun
- Emily, Brandyn, Ray, and Abhinav hosted a Seattle week visit
- Belal and teammate had happy hour in NYC and co-working session
- Dan feels welcomed and part of the team

**On-Call Improvements:**
- On-call feels better compared to a month ago
- Less like a nightmare thanks to team efforts to shore things up
- Only got paged once (and it was transient)
- On-call has seemed to calm down
- On-call is less frequent with new folks joining the rotation

**Project Achievements:**
- Huge shoutout for Proxima work and CCA testing (Brandyn, Kinsey, and others)
- People pairing more on epics together
- Emily excited to DRI (Directly Responsible Individual) on sunsetting extensions
- Shoutout to Ray for driving job queuing work with Colby for GA readiness
- Amazing progress on job queuing

**Team Dynamics:**
- Brandyn recognized for great coding, devops skills
- Ray stepping in as interim manager (familiar face, not a stranger)
- Excited about Ray as interim manager
- Nice to hear about different vacations and biking tours
- Agent-session-experience team developing more structure

### 3. **Learnings, Questions, Concerns Section**
The team raised several important questions and concerns:

**Support & Process:**
- Support escalations - discussion about Tim handling these, wondering if FR (First Responder) should help with bandwidth
- Question about clarity on next steps/vision - improvements made with planning/release issues/demo meetings
- Potential for GitHub actions to automate FR item creation (mentioned Slack integration experience)

**Organizational Clarity:**
- Can still lack clarity on DRI and ownership, especially with external teams
- Hard to keep up with Slack discussions, feeling like missing important conversations
- Too many DM interrupts (suggestion to ignore more)
- Lots of Slack noise acknowledged
- Keep getting tagged to fix Blackbird/MCP issues (questioning if organizational vs. personal issue - "Belal is The MCP Guy vs. Belal is on a team")

**Planning & Communication:**
- Next brown bag topic to be determined
- Universe launches still not solidified (though being populated in release issues with "universe release" label)
- Uncertainty about who's in coding-agent-team channel and their relevance
- Curious about voice at the table for GA discussions and expected load on team
- When will offsite be? (Answer: October, probably after Universe, TBD)
- Lack of high-level overview in larger group meetings

**Workload Concerns:**
- Burned out from Proxima work for over a month (not well organized but happy it's landing)
- Feels like sessions experience getting "shiny new toy" attention
- Difficulty holding team accountable for solving FR issues vs. feature work (FR work gets fewer "points")

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Refine FR backlog
- Try tools to summarize Slack
- Whole org running and communicating more clearly
- Already pairing and doing brownbags
- Ask folks to create issues instead of interrupts
- Assign Copilot to write docs on code (Cal's suggestion)
- Route to public team channel to create issues
- Be kind with timelines/estimates - spend time upfront to avoid over-committing

### 4. **Lacked/Do Less (Negatives) Section**
This section was present but specific negative items weren't fully detailed in the extracted data.

### 5. **Take Aways Section**
This section was designated for key learnings and action items from the retrospective.

### 6. **Icebreaker: "If you were an inanimate object, what would you be?"**
Fun team responses:
- "Something versatile, maybe like a plate bowl or a super functional bag / What I would probably be: A radio"
- "Enigmatic and unique work of art that has at least a hundred year run in a museum somewhere and then gets burned down in a large fire"
- "Porsche 911 Turbo S or Super sonic Jet"
- "A plate of warm chocolate chip cookies"
- "Stuffed animal"
- "Old man's breath moss - it's moss that only grows in the cleanest air in rainforests"

## Guidelines for Participation
- **Try to limit 1-2 post-its per category per person**
- **If you particularly agree with someone's post-it, add a react!**
- Example shown: "Being focused on fewer things worked better"

## Key Themes
1. **Team Growth**: Successfully onboarding new members and building strong collaboration
2. **On-Call Improvements**: Significant progress in reducing on-call burden and incidents
3. **Communication Challenges**: Need for better Slack management, clearer DRI assignments, and reduced interrupts
4. **Process Maturity**: Evolving processes for releases, planning, and cross-team coordination
5. **Work-Life Balance**: Concerns about burnout and workload distribution
6. **Technical Achievements**: Major accomplishments with Proxima, job queuing, and GA preparation
